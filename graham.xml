        <head>PREFACE</head>
        <p>The publication of this book under the title of the TAR-HEEL WAR RECORD is an effort to perpetuate to some extent a record of the activities of sons and daughters of the Old North State who were active participants in the great war at home and abroad. It is thought by the publishers that there is a place for such a volume and the following pages are the result of a systematic canvas, bringing together for the benefit of home-folks, relatives and friends (as nearly as possible) an authentic account of the war record of their loved ones. In the years that will swiftly follow this book's publication it will increase in worth to them as a memory of a very epochal time in the history of the world, our country, our state and our home.</p>

        <head>FOREWORD</head>
        <p>North Carolina may well feel a strong thrill of pride when the noble enterprise of its men and women during the period of the great world conflict is rehearsed. The men were eager and willing to respond to Old Glory's call to arms and the women at home lost no time in busying themselves in things intended to lessen the suffering of those over-seas. The splendid manhood of the Old North State manifested itself time and again on the field of battle and on the high seas. How many times a North Carolinian's name went down into imperishable fame for deeds of valor and self sacrifice in behalf of the greatest cause of all time. The women at home, God bless them, spurred them on to high purpose, fired their souls with memories of their illustrious ancestors in the days of '64 and afforded them that warmth of love and trust and faith that kept them from doing not less than the best that was in them. Many of our women went overseas as nurses, and canteen workers, and one is sure that their very presence was a blessing to our men. At home in the great drives for humane institutions they surpassed themselves in the good they accomplished.</p>
        <p>Within the covers of this book are presented symposiums of many who gave of themselves and of their substance that the world might be made safe to live in and that the despots of Europe might be erased from the maps of the future generations. When one views the war in retrospection it is then that these sketches gain the significance that give them the place in every North Carolina home that they deserve. There is doubtless in this book mention of some loved one, set forth in all truthfulness, that gives him or her a little firmer hold on our heart.</p>
        <p>The publishers have spent considerable time, money and effort in bringing out this book, but the compensation that is theirs in feeling that they have produced a work worth while is worth more than the material gain to be derived from their labors.</p>
        <p>As it goes to press the writer is looking over several of the proof sheets. He sees many of his dearest friends in the eulogies and one in particular who has died since the book was planned. He was a veteran of the overseas army and contracted trouble of the stomach from which he never fully recovered and which finally resulted in his death. He was a modest fellow, the best friend that one could desire, and when I wrote up a brief review of his service I did so with due modesty, for I knew well how strongly he would object to anything flowery. He just simply wanted the plain facts, without frills. And that is the way he lived and of such men North Carolina is justly proud, for he is typical of the fineness of the manhood of the state.</p>
        <p>We are well aware that in the Liberty Loan Drives North Carolina exceeded her quotas. She exceeded because of the enthusiasm that is hers and the power of pride behind her. In all other drives she duplicated success with success.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, Tar Helia has a world war record that is brim-full of accomplishment and it is hoped that this book may be a lasting tribute to the courage of her men and the character of her women.</p>

        <head>IN MEMORIAM</head>
        <p>To the Stainless Knights of a stainless cause, who gave their lives for  humanity, and the right, in the Great World War.</p>
        <p>“Gone West”—Over the purple hills and beyond the softly glowing rim of life's day, the warrior's spirit takes its flight. Out of the morning, across the white archway of noontide, down to the sunset. Out of the din and clamor, out of the bitterness and strife, out of the fierce passion of the combat, into the dreamless silence whose shadows mark the pathway to the stars. Beyond earth's darkening horizon, through the curtained gloom of night, far from the shoreless sea of fadeless light. Out of the agony of life's Gethsemane, over the quaking summit of Calvary, into the realm of glory, where God's banners never furl, where victory is sure. So the Stainless Knight of a stainless cause moves down the West where earth's last glimmer fades and dies and into God's spreading dawn whose light is eternal, whose breath is cool and sweet. “Gone West.”</p>

            <p>[BOND, EDWARD G.]</p>
          </figure>
        </p>
        <p>BOND, EDWARD G., Lieut., was born in Edenton, North Carolina, on the 16th of May, 1890. He was a son of Judge and Mrs. W. M. Bond. After attending the Graded School at Edenton he was sent to Randolph-Macon Academy at Bedford, Virginia, and from there was later sent to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. There he united with the Delta Kappa Epsilon Fraternity, and after completing his studies at said University he remained there and read law. Completing his law course, he passed the examination for license to practice before the Supreme Court of North Carolina before his twenty-first birthday. At each of the schools he was regarded as a close and diligent student, and in the few years after he received his law license he rapidly arose in the profession. He was of broad reading, with most retentive memory, a strong public speaker and most interesting in private conversation. Never having been connected in any way with military service, when trouble was threatened along the Mexican border he volunteered and became a member of Company I, an old Edenton military company. He was soon thereafter sent to Camp Glenn, in North Carolina, and after staying there several weeks was sent with his company to the border. When the trouble there had subsided, the regiment to which he belonged was returned to Goldsboro, N. C., and was not disbanded, as it then seemed very certain that our government would soon be involved in war with Germany. Serving at Goldsboro, Charlotte, Hillsboro and other places in guarding bridges and performing various details of military service, he was finally sent to Camp Sevier, near Greenville, S. C. There he remained until he was sent, in May, 1918, as a member of Company L, 119th Infantry, Thirtieth Division, to France. He remained attached to that company until he was sent to a competitive school in Langres, France. After remaining at said school for a period of time he was commissioned and assigned to Company L, 39th Infantry, Fourth Division. On October 10, 1918, he was mortally wounded in battle near Bois de Foret in the Argonne Forest, and from there was finally removed to the hospital in the city of Limoges, where he died from the wounds on November 10, 1918, and was buried in the American Military Cemetery at Limoges, France. He was at all times connected with the Infantry and his commission as Second Lieutenant was dated September 25, 1918.</p>
        <p>Letters from comrades received since his death impute to him full and complete discharge of his duty and speak in the highest terms of his valor and determination as a soldier. He appeared to regard his service to his country as a matter of patriotic duty, which is attested by the fact that a few days before he was wounded he closed a letter by saying:</p>
        <q direct="unspecified">
          <p>“No matter what happens, don't worry about me. I hold my life a matter of little concern in great questions affecting humanity and civilization.”</p>
        </q>
        <p>His older brother lives in Denver, Colorado, practicing law there. His younger brother, before his twentieth birthday, filed application for enlistment into the Aviation service.</p>
        <p>The subject of this sketch was well educated, of high character and widely acquainted.</p>
        <p>Lieut. Bond was the only member of the D. K. E. Fraternity at the University of North Carolina who died in battle or from wounds received in battle, and the society has requested and received a large photograph of him which now hangs on its wall in their hall at Chapel Hill.</p>

        <p>For extraordinary heroism in action on August 27, 1918, Sgt. Hinson was in charge of a platoon, delivering a highly concentrated gas cloud attack against the enemy, when the cloud unexpectedly flared back. After leading the men to a place of safety, this soldier went back into the cloud four times at imminent peril to his own life, collecting and rescuing others who had been overcome. Conducting his platoon through heavy machine-gun fire, he put them in charge of another sergeant with instructions to resume their mission, while he again returned to search for gassed men and found all but two. His excellent leadership and unusual courage prevented many casualties and at the same time effected the completion of an important mission.

            <p>This sketch will give you some faint conception of the effect of high explosive shells. I take no man's word for this, as it came under my personal observation. People often ask the question: “How does it seem to be hit by a piece of a shell?” And it was probably never better answered than by the British Tommy, who said: “First you 'ears a 'ell of a noise, next you see a nurse bendin' over you, an' 'ear 'er say, ‘See if you can drink some of this.’”</p>
            <p>For months you have been seeing in the papers pictures of demolished villages and shell pitted areas, and perhaps you have wondered whether or not the pictures were overdrawn. Let me assure you that they were not, for many and many a time I have gazed on artillery effects that it would be mpossible to exaggerate.</p>
            <p>Instances are related of heroic French artillerymen who have shelled their own homes to fragments because German soldiers had taken possession of, and were occupying them. How can Germany or any other nation expect to crush a people of such indomitable resolution?</p>

            <p>We are back at Brest again, and instead of pup-tents for shelter, we have barracks; instead of walking in mud, we have duck boards; and instead of cooking our own meals, we have someone to do it. Uncle Sam is sure good to his boys.</p>

            <p>In the olden days of knighthood a beautiful young lady lived here and as all young ladies are, she was deeply in love with a man. He was a man of wealth, fashion and society, a gambler and a drunkard. The priest told him that if he did not stop his evil ways the Lord would destroy him with fire and water. He heeded not the advice, and one day while crossing the Sarth River, lightning struck him and he fell into the water, dead.</p>
            <p>The young lady, to mourn the loss of her lover, locked herself in one of the rooms in this chateau, and stayed shut in for fifty years, when she died. Today the hole in the wall through which she received her meals, is still there.</p>

            <p>Here is a little insect that with all his faults, and they are many, possesses certain virtues. He has solved the problem of race suicide, for he multiplies with astounding rapidity. He adapts himself easily, not to say gracefully, to uncomfortable, even unsanitary surroundings, and if he were permitted to speak in his own defense, would doubtless challenge you to show on all the pages of history any great military success attained by an army not accompanied and “egged on” as it were by cooties.

          <head>ORGANIZATION AND TRAINING IN FRANCE</head>
          <p>The 30th Division is a distinctively American division. More than 95 per cent of its personnel is of American born parents. The Division is constituted of National Guard troops of North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee, augmented by many thousands of selective draft troops from the states of Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee.</p>
          <p>The division was dubbed “Old Hickory” after the warrior and statesman, Andrew Jackson, who was so closely identified with the history of the states furnishing the major portion of its personnel.</p>
          <p>The Old Hickory Division landed at the port of Calais, France, on the 24th day of May, 1918, and was billeted in the Eperlecques Training Area. While in this area the officers of the division reconnoitered the Terdeghen Switch Line, south of Cassel, and complete plans were
<pb id="p212" n="[212]"/>
formulated for the occupation of this line by forced marches in case of emergency.</p>
          <p>Before the completion of its training period the division was transferred to the II British Corps, Second Army, in the Ypres sector to be in close support in case of the expected German offensive. This division, the first American division to enter that kingdom, marched into Belgium on July 4th, with Division Headquarters at Waton, to be in close support of the 33d and 49th British Divisions, and was employed in completing the constuction of the East and West Poperinghe Defense Systems immediately in rear of these two divisions. An immense amount of trench and wire construction was done. Complete plans and orders were issued for the occupation of the East and West Poperinghe Systems by the 30th Division in the event of a German attack and a forced withdrawal of the British divisions in the front. The division received training in the front line with the 33d and 49th Divisions, first as individuals, then by platoons, and lastly by entire battalions.</p>
          <p>On August 17th, 1918, the division took over the entire sector occupied by the 33d British Division, 60th Brigade being in the front line, 59th Brigade in support. This was known as the Canal Sector and extended from the southern outskirts of Ypres to the vicinity of Voormezeele, a distance of 2,400 meters.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="section">
          <head>THE FIRST OFFENSIVE</head>
          <p>On August 31st and September 1st the division engaged in an offensive in conjunction with the 14th British Division on the left and the 27th American Division on the right. The 30th Division captured all its objectives, including Lock No. 8, Lankhof Farm, and the City of Voormezeele, advancing fifteen hundred yards, capturing fifteen prisoners, two machine guns and thirty-five rifles. As a result of this advance the 236th Division which was considered an average German division, was identified. During the six weeks previous to this advance many attempts had been made by the British and our own troops to identify this German division.</p>
          <p>On September 4th-5th the division was withdrawn from the Canal Sector and placed in British G. H. Q. reserve with Division Headquarters at Roellecourt, France. while in this area the entire division was trained in attacking in conjunction with British tanks.</p>
          <p>On September 17th the division was again moved farther south, with Division Headquarters at Herissart, and on September 22d was moved to the British Fourth Army, with Division Headquarters at Bois de Buire, near Tincourt, taking over a front line sector from the 1st Australian Division on the night of 23d-24th.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="section">
          <head>HINDENBURG LINE (BELLICOURT)</head>
          <p>On September 29th this division with the 27th American Division on the left and the 46th British Division on the right assaulted the Hindenburg Line. The Hindenburg Line at this point curves in front of the Tunnel St. Quentin. This was considered impregnable by the Germans for the following reasons: The Hindenburg Line curving west of the tunnel consisted of three main trench systems protected by vast fields of heavy barbed wire entanglements skillfully placed. This wire was very heavy and had been damaged very little by artillery fire. The dominating ground enabled them to bring devastating machine gun fire on all approaches. The lines had been strengthened with concrete machine gun emplacements. It contained at this point a large number of dugouts lined with mining timbers, with wooden steps leading down to a depth of about 30 feet, with small rooms capable of holding from four to six men each. In many cases these dugouts were wired for electric lights. The large tunnel through which the canal ran was of sufficient capacity to shelter a division. This tunnel was electrically lighted and filled with barges. Connecting it with the Hindenburg trench system were numerous tunnels. In one case a direct tunnel ran from the main tunnel to the basement of a large stone building, which the enemy used for headquarters. Other tunnels ran from the main tunnel eastward to the City of Bellicourt and other places. This complete subterranean system with its hidden exits and entrances, unknown to us, formed a most complete and safe subterranean method of communication and reinforcement for the German sector.</p>
          <p>The 30th Division, the 60th Brigade augmented by units of the 117th Infantry, attacking, assaulted this line at 5:10 A. M., September 29th, on a front of three thousand yards, captured the entire Hindenburg System of that sector and advanced farther, capturing the tunnel system with the German troops therein and took the Cities of Bellicourt, Nauroy, Riqueval, Carriere, Etricourt, Guillaine Ferme and Ferme de Riqueval, advancing four thousand two hundred yards, defeating two enemy divisions of average quality (the 75th Reserve Division and the 185th Division), taking as prisoners 47 officers and 1,434 men.</p>
          <p>On October 1st-2d the 30th Division was relieved by the 5th Australian Division and moved to back area with Division Headquarters at Herbecourt. The division scarcely reached this area when it was marched back and took over the front line in the same sector from the 2d Australian Division near Montbrehain on the night of 4th-5th.</p>

          <p>On October 8th, 9th, 10th and 11th the 30th Division attacked each day, advancing 17,500 yards, and capturing le Tilleul d'Archies, le Petit Cambresis, Becquigny, Mon. Sarasin, le Trou Aux Soldats, Busigny, Gloriette, le Vert Donjon, Escaufourt, le Rond Pont, Vaux Andigny, Vallee Hasard, la Haie Menneresse, la Rochelle, le Vent de Bise, St. Souplet, St. Benin, Malassise, Geneve, half of Monthrehain, Brancourt, Premont, Vaux le Pretre, Brancoucourt, Fraicourt Ferme, Bois Mirand, Butry Ferme, la Sabliere Bois, Becquignette Ferme, Bois de Malmaison, Malmaison Ferme, Bois de Busigny, Bois l'Ermitage, Bois Proyart, Imberfayt and Du Guet Fassiaux Fermes, taking prisoner 45 officers and 1,889 men. The 59th Brigade began this attack on October 8th and captured all their objectives, including Premont and Brancourt. During this operation from October 8th to 11th the 30th Division encountered units from fourteen German divisions, classified by the British High Command as follows: 34th Division, average; 20th Division, very good; 24th Division, very good; 21st Division, average; 21st Reserve Division, average; 38th Division, very good; 119th Division, average; 121st Division, average; 187th Sharpshooting Section, very good; 204th Division, average; 208th Division, average; 3d Naval Division, very good; 15th Reserve Division, average.</p>
          <p>The 30th Division was relieved by the 27th Division on October 11th-12th, but returned on October 16th and took over a part of the same line at the same place, being the right half of the sector temporarily held by the 27th. The next attack was launched on October 17th, 18th and 19th against the 221st Division, average; 243d Division, average; 29th Division, very good, advancing

nine thousand yards and capturing 6 officers and 412 men, and the towns of Molain, St. Martin Riviere, Ribeauville, Ecaillon, Mazinghein, and Ribeaucourt Ferme.</p>
          <p>During much of the fighting from October 8th to 11th and from 17th to 19th difficulties of the terrain were very great, with the country greatly broken by small patches of woods and villages, with uneven terrain and occasional large towns admirably added to the machine gun defense of which the Germans took every advantage. The La Selle River with high banks beyond was obstinately defended. In spite of these difficulties the advance continued, often without artillery support, and was made possible only by the determination of the men and the skillful use of all arms combined with clever utilization of the diversified terrain. The 3d German Naval Division of the crack German divisions was hastily thrown in in an attempt to stop the advance.</p>
          <p>The division was then withdrawn to the Heilly Training Area, near Amiens, for replacements and a well-earned rest.; Division Headquarters at Querrieu. Two weeks later, when orders for an immediate return to the front were expected daily, the armistice with Germany was signed November 11th, 1918. The fighting being over, the II American Corps was released from the British E. F. with which it had been associated since its arrival in France, and transferred to the American E. F. in the Le Mans area, where the first units of the 30th Division arrived and Division Headquarters opened at Ballon on November 21st.</p>
          <p>During the above operations the advance was so rapid and the troops withdrawn so soon, there was no opportunity to gather up and salvage a great number of guns and supplies captured, which were left for the salvage troops of the Fourth British Army. Upon a partial check by the units of the division, it is known that at least 72 field artillery pieces, 26 trench mortars, 426 machine guns, and 1,792 rifles were captured, in addition to the great mass of material. This represents but a portion of the captures. In many instances field guns taken from the Germans were turned over to the supporting artillery and used by them upon the retreating enemy.</p>
          <p>Total number of prisoners captured by this division from September 29th to October 20th: 98 officers, 3,750 men. During the same period we lost 3 officers and 24 men as prisoners, 44 officers and 1,011 men killed, 113 officers and 4,823 men wounded (including slightly wounded and slightly gassed).</p>
          <p>It is quite interesting to note the following tabulation which shows the number of civilians liberated by the Division durng its advances:</p>

                  <p>General Orders: No. 33.</p>
                  <p>1. The Division Commander wishes to congratulate the 30th Division upon the success of its first divisional action, and to express appreciation of the courage, fortitude and devotion displayed by its personnel.</p>
                  <p>2. To be given the task, in its initial effort, to play an important role in breaking through the HINDENBURG line, the stronegst defenses on the Western Front, was a great honor, and the fact that the break-through was actually made on the divisional front is ample evidence that the honor was not misplaced, and is a credit to the fighting efficiency of the Division, of the command of which the undersigned has every reason to be proud.</p>
                  <p>3. The Division retires temporarily for reorganization and well-earned rest, but with a feeling of satisfaction at a task well done and with augmented faith in itself.</p>
                  <p>4. There is deep and keen regret for the gallant comrades who have gloriously died, and an earnest intention of further perfection as a combat organization in order that the Division may do to the fullest extent possible its share in bringing about the early success of the great cause in which they have fallen.</p>
                  <p>5. This order will be read to every organization at its first formation and be posted on bulletin boards.</p>

                  <p>As the II American Corps has now been withdrawn from the line, and my official association with you and your troops has been, for the time being, suspended, I desire to express to you the great pleasure that it has been to me and to the troops of the Australian Army Corps to have been so closely allied to you in the recent very important battle operations which have resulted in the breaking through of the main HINDENBURG line on the front of the Fourth British Army.</p>
                  <p>Now that fuller details of the work done by the 27th and 30th Divisions have become available, the splendid gallantry and devotion of the troops in these operations have won the admiration of their Australian comrades. The tasks set were formidable, but the American troops overcame all obstacles and contributed in a very high degree to the ultimate capture of the whole tunnel system.</p>
                  <p>I shall be glad if you will convey to your Division Commanders my appreciation of and thanks for the work done, and to accept my best wishes for every possible success in the future. Yours very sincerely,</p>

Called upon to attack positions of great strength held by a determined enemy, all ranks of the 27th and 30th divisions under your command displayed an energy, courage and determination in attack which proved irresistible. It does not need me to tell you that in the heavy fighting of the past three weeks you have earned the lasting esteem and admiration of your British comrades-in-arms whose success you have so nobly shared.</p>

                  <p>General Orders: No. 38</p>
                  <p>1. The 30th Division again retires for rest and reorganization after adding another chapter to its already glorious record.</p>
                  <p>2. With the exception of three days—October 12th, 13th and 14th—when it was in reserve, the Division attacked every day from October 8th to October 19th, inclusive, defeating the enemy and making material gains each day. During this period the lines were advanced by the Division from MONTBREHAIN to beyond MAZINGHEIN, a distance of more than thirteen miles, and the towns of BRANCOURT, PREMONT, BUSIGNY, VAUX ANDIGNY, ESCAUFOURT, ST. BENIN, ST. SOUPLET, RIBEAUVILLE and MAZINGHEIN, as well as many villages and farms, were taken.</p>
                  <p>3. During this period 45 officers and 1,889 other ranks were taken prisoners and nearly forty cannon, a large number of machine guns and an immense amount of stores of all kinds were captured by the Division.</p>
                  <p>4. The skill, courage, fortitude and endurance displayed by the Division have won the admiration of all and the commendation of High Commanders.</p>
                  <p>5. Holding in affectionate memory the comrades who have fallen, justly proud of its glorious achievements already accomplished, the Division will devote itself untiringly to reorganization and rehabilitation in the confidence that when again called upon it will, as in the past, be found equal to any task that may be assigned to it.</p>

                  <p>II American Corps.</p>
                  <p>Now that the American Corps has come out of the line for a well-earned period of rest and training, I desire to place on record my appreciation of the gallantry and the fine soldierly spirit they have displayed throughout the recent hard fighting.</p>
                  <p>The breaking of the great HINDENBURG system of defense, coupled with the capture of BRANCOURT, BUSIGNY and ST. SOUPLET, and finally the forcing of the passages of the SELLE river, constitute a series of victories of which each officer, N.C.O. and man has every reason to feel proud.</p>
                  <p>The Corps has been very well supported by the artillery of the Australian Corps, to whom I desire to offer my best thanks for their skill and endurance during the long months they have now been in action.</p>
                  <p>The efficiency with which the staff work of the Corps has been carried out on this their first experience as a fighting Corps in the line of battle has filled me with admiration, and I attribute it largely to the zeal and unity of purpose which has throughout animated the whole Corps.</p>
                  <p>The outstanding feature of their recent victories has been the surpassing gallantry and self-sacrifice of the regimental officers and men. I congratulate them on their prowess and offer them one and all my warmest thanks for the leading part they have taken in the recent operations.</p>
                  <p>It is possible now to give the Corps a period of rest, during which special attention should be paid to the training of the smaller units in minor tactics, such as the attack of strong points and machine gun nests. The experience they have had of actual combat will assist them to improve their fighting efficiency in this respect.</p>
                  <p>In thanking the Corps as a whole for the great services they have rendered to the Allied cause, I desire to wish all ranks the best good fortune in the future.</p>

Referring to the telegram from the Commander-in-Chief of appreciation of the sacrifice and service of the troops of the American Expedtionary Force, I feel that it should be impressed upon the men of our command that they, and the organizations to which they belong, have played an exceptional part in bringing about the magnificent results which the Commander-in-Chief has so warmly eulogized, and that every advantage should be taken of this expression of what has been done in the past and confidence as to the future by those in command to inpsire their men with pride in the service they have had as soldiers in the Army of the United States, and to keep alive this “proud consciousness of a new Americanism born of sacrifice.”</p>
                  <p>2. I would request that you convey to your command my appreciation of the part they have taken in our great victory, and my thanks for their heroic devotion to duty; and that I share with them their sorrow for fallen comrades, and their pride in the high achievements of the men of this Corps.</p>

                  <p>Now that the American II Corps is leaving the British zone, I wish once more to thank you and all officers, non-commissioned officers and men under your command, on behalf both of myself and all ranks of the British Armies in France and Flanders for the very gallant and efficient service you have rendered during the period of your operations with the Fourth British Army.</p>
                  <p>On the 29th September you took part with distinction in the great and critical attack which shattered the enemy's resistance in the HINDENBURG line and opened the road to final victory. The deeds of the 27th and 30th American Division, who on that day took BELLICOURT and NAUROY and so gallantly sustained the desperate struggle for BONY, will rank with the highest achievements of this war. They will always be remembered by the British Regiments that fought beside you.</p>
                  <p>Since that date, through three weeks of almost continuous fighting, you advanced from one success to another, overcoming all resistance, beating off numerous counter attacks, and capturing several thousand prisoners and many guns. The names of BRANCOURT, PREMONT, BUSIGNY, VAUX ANDIGNY, ST. SOUPLET and MAZINGHEIN testify to the dash and energy of your attacks.</p>
                  <p>I rejoice at the success which has attended your efforts and I am proud to have had you under my command.</p>

<salute>My Dear General Lewis:</salute></opener>
                  <p>It gives me much pleasure to extend to you and the officers and men of the 30th Division my sincere compliments upon their appearance at the review and inspection on the 21st of January, southwest of Tielle, which was excellent and is just what would be expected in a command with such a splendid fighting record.</p>
                  <p>After its preliminary training the division entered the line on July 16th, where it remained almost continuously until the end of October. In that time it was in the actual battle from the 30th of August and took part in the Ypres-Lys and Somme offensives. On September 29th the division broke through both the Hindenburg and the Le Catelet-Nauroy lines, capturing Bellicourt and Nauroy, an operation on which all subsequent action of the 4th British Army depended. From October 7th to October 20th, the division advanced 23 kilometers in a continued series of attacks, capturing 2,352 of the enemy. Brancourt, Premont, Busigny, St. Benin, St. Souplet and Escaufourt, La Haie, Minneresse and Vaux Andigny are names which will live in the memories of those who fought in the 30th Division. But its especial glory will always be the honor you won by breaking the Hindenburg line on September 29th. Such a record is one of which we are all proud.</p>
                  <p>It is gratifying to see your troops in such good physical shape, but still more so to know that this almost ideal condition will continue to the end of their service and beyond, as an exemplification of their high character and soldierly qualities.</p>
                  <p>I inspected the artillery brigade of the division later, and found the same high standard of personnel that marks the rest of the division.</p>

                  <p>General Orders: No. 39-A</p>
                  <p>My Fellow Soldiers:</p>
                  <p>Now that your service with the American Expeditionary Forces is about to terminate, I cannot let you go without a personal word. At the call to arms, the patriotic young manhood of America eagerly responded and became the formidable army whose decisive victories testify to its efficiency and its valor. With the support of the nation firmly united to defend the cause of liberty, our army has executed the will of the people with resolute purpose. Our democracy has been tested, and the forces of autocracy have been defeated. To the glory of the citizen-soldier, our troops have faithfully fulfilled their trust, and in a succession of brilliant offensives have overcome the menace to our civilization.</p>
                  <p>As an individual, your part in the world war has been an important one in the sum total of our achievements.
<pb id="p218" n="[218]"/>
Whether keeping lonely vigil in the trenches, or gallantly storming the enemy's stronghold; whether enduring monotonous drudgery at the rear, or sustaining the fighting line at the front, each has bravely and efficiently played his part. By willing sacrifice of personal rights; by cheerful endurance of hardship and privation; by vigor, strength and indomitable will, made effective by thorough organization and cordial co-operation, you inspired the war-worn Allies with new life and turned the tide of threatened defeat into overwhelming victory.</p>
                  <p>With a consecrated devotion to duty and a will to conquer, you have loyally served your country. By your exemplary conduct a standard has been established and maintained never before attained by any army. With mind and body as clean and strong as the decisive blows you delivered against the foe, you are soon to return to the pursuits of peace. In leaving the scenes of your victories, may I ask that you carry home your high ideals and continue to live as you have served—an honor to the principles for which you have fought and to the fallen comrades you leave behind.</p>
                  <p>It is with pride in our success that I extend to you my sincere thanks for your splendid service to the army and to the nation.</p>

<salute>Notice! All Members of the 30th Division:</salute></opener>
                  <p>The great name of the “Old Hickory Division” and your brave and noble deeds are to be incorporated in the records for future generations. In order that the ties of comradeship and service, which have cemented you together, may not fall asunder and disappear, an Association of the division has been formed. This association will meet each year where its members may renew their friendships and acquaintances enjoyed during the real life of the division, and where their deeds and services can be recalled, which deeds and services have justly entitled the division to the recognition throughout the world as one of the greatest divisions in American military history.</p>
                  <p>The following is a short synopsis of the tentative organization, subject to change and ratification at the first annual convention:</p>
                  <list type="simple">
                    <item>Name: “Old Hickory (30th) Division Association.”</item>
                    <item>Date of First Convention: September 28,29, 1919.</item>
                    <item>Place: To be announced later.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>The undersigned Organization Committee was selected at a meeting held February 27th, 1919. This meeting was composed of all General Officers of the division, the Chief of Staff, Chiefs of Sections of the General Staff, Chiefs of Services, and all Regimental and Independent Unit Commanders, who represented all organizations and all departments of the division. There will be, in addition to the Organization Committee, the following subcommittees:</p>
                  <list type="simple">
                    <item>Committee on Membership.</item>
                    <item>Committee on Constitution and By-Laws.</item>
                    <item>Committee on Arrangements.</item>
                    <item>Committee on Finance.</item>
                    <item>Committee on Historical Records.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>These committees, representing all organizations and composed of all ranks, have commenced work in the exercise of their duties with a view of having all arrangements for the first convention. At this convention the permanent organization will be formed.</p>
                  <p>Dues: Dues for the first year will be two and one-half (2½f.) francs, payable here, or fifty (50c.) cents in the States. All dues will be paid in to the person designated by the Unit Commander, who will turn them over to the Division Disbursing Quartermaster, together with the name, organization and home address of each member. The Disbursing Quartermaster will turn over the funds to the temporary Secretary when appointed.</p>
                  <p>On arrival in the States, a systematic publicity campaign will be started for the promotion and advertisement of the coming convention. All members of the division who have not joined before demobilization will send their dues to the Secretary, giving their full name, organization and home address.</p>
                  <p>As outlined in Paragraph 1, this Association is organized to perpetuate the division in the future and for the pleasure of its members. It is, therefore, incumbent upon all members of the division to become members of the Association and to do all possible to promote its interest. The first convention is going to be a great one in the history of the division, and all members should begin preparation now to be present. The place for the convention, as well as all other details of interest that will subsequently develop, will be announced through the press as early as practicable.</p>
                  <p>The hearty interest and co-operation of all members of the division are earnestly and respectfully solicited.</p>
