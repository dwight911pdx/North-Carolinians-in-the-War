        <p>After three months<lb/>hard and intense<lb/>training at Ft. Ogle-<lb/>thorpe Ga, I was<lb/>commissioned as<lb/>a second Lt. Inf.<lb/>O. R. C. I was<lb/>appointed Aug. 15<lb/>1917, and was<lb/>ordered into active<lb/>Service on that<lb/>date, with orders<lb/>to report at Camp<lb/>Jackson, Columbia<lb/>S. C. Aug. 29, 1917.</p>

        <p>My leave of absense<lb/>is past. Reported<lb/>this morning at<lb/>Camp Jackson. The <lb/>past ten days have<lb/>been pleasant ones<lb/>for me. Went to Kinston<lb/>on Sun. night, Aug 19.<lb/>and stayed until<lb/>Wed. night Aug. 22.<lb/>Saw there many<lb/>dear friends and<lb/>the handshake of<lb/>each made my heart<lb/>glad. Spent Sun.<lb/>night with Mac Lewis.<lb/>and took breakfast<lb/>there also Mon. A fine<lb/>home, and always<lb/>nice to me. Took<lb/>dinner that day with<lb/>Red Allen, son of Judge<lb/>O. H. Allen, one of the
<pb id="umstead03" n="[3]" entity="umstead03"/>most godly men I<lb/>have ever seen. Took<lb/>supper, and spent<lb/>the night with Mr.<lb/>and Mrs. Hines, in<lb/>whose home I lived<lb/>while teaching in<lb/>Kinston. I always<lb/>will love them, and<lb/>feel at ease in their<lb/>home. Robert and Willis<lb/>are still my partners.<lb/>Took breakfast there.<lb/>Took dinner Tues. Aug<lb/>21, at Frank Hooker's. <lb/>Met his father, mother, <lb/>and sisters. The<lb/>hospitality of their<lb/>home was delightful.<lb/>Frank was a pupil<lb/>of mine, and very<lb/>near to me.

        <p>Spent Tues. night with<lb/>Ely Perry. The Perry<lb/>home is a delightful place.<lb/>So homelike, and hospitable.<lb/>Suse, her mother and<lb/>Ely have always been<lb/>especially nice to me,<lb/>and Noah also. Took<lb/>breakfast there.</p>

        <p>Took supper at the<lb/>Perrys' home, and left<lb/>on the 7.38 train for home.<lb/>Wanted to stay over to<lb/>the danse that night, but<lb/>wanted to get home. A good<lb/>number were down at the<pb id="umstead07" n="[7]" entity="umstead07"/>Station to tell me good<lb/>bye.

        <p>I arrived home safely<lb/>Thurs. morning.</p>
        <p>I spent Fri. in Roxboro.<lb/>Lucille went with me.<lb/>We took dinner at the<lb/>Newell home. Was delightful.<lb/>Met Miss Francis Sessons<lb/>from Lillington. Very<lb/>attractive. Took supper<lb/>at Sue Langs. Think she<lb/>is one of the finest women<lb/>I have ever seen. A fine<lb/>physique, attractive personality,<lb/>and a head full of sense.<lb/>The man who weds her<lb/>will be lucky, and unless<lb/>an unusual man, will<lb/>not be worthy of her.<lb/>Mr. Will brought us<lb/>home that night. Mary<lb/>Houres came with us.<lb/>Mr. Will is a fine man,<lb/>and one whom I like<lb/>very much. His kindness<pb id="umstead08" n="[8]" entity="umstead08"/>to me have been many.</p>
        <p>From then until Mon-<lb/>day night, I stayed<lb/>at home, where I enjoy<lb/>being above all places<lb/>in the world. Sun. night<lb/>Aug. 26. I made a talk<lb/>at, and conducted prayer<lb/>meeting at Mt. Bethel<lb/>church. Enjoyed it, and<lb/>received much benefit<lb/>from it.</p>
        <p>Probably the saddest<lb/>time I have ever spent<lb/>was Mon. night. Aug 27.<lb/>when I left home. I<lb/>left father and mother<lb/>in tears, and it almost<lb/>wrung my heart from<lb/>within me. To leave<lb/>them, old and feeble at<lb/>home alone was the<lb/>most difficult task<lb/>of my life. It is easy<lb/>enough to go to the execu-<lb/>tion of one's duty, when<lb/>that duty may mean<lb/>death, when there is<lb/>no one but yourself,<lb/>but to leave parents<pb id="umstead09" n="[9]" entity="umstead09"/>whose joy in life rests<lb/>in their paternal interest<lb/>in you, is the saddest and<lb/>most trying of all tasks.</p>
        <p>I sometimes think that <lb/>the lives lost in war <lb/>are trivial in comparison <lb/>with the grief and sorrows <lb/>their deaths leave in the <lb/>aching hearts of their <lb/>dear ones. I left with <lb/>a heavy heart, trying <lb/>to bear up manly<lb/>under a burden which<lb/>almost broke me down.<lb/>That parting picture<lb/>will be clear in my mind's<lb/>eye as long as I live.</p>
        <p>It is hard to render one's <lb/>duty to one's country when <lb/>it seems to conflict with<lb/>duty to parents. I chose<lb/>my course, after trying<lb/>to select the right course.<lb/>God knows I did what<lb/>I think is right, and<lb/>may God care for those<lb/>I left behind.</p>

        <p>Columbia, with its many <lb/>colonial style homes and<lb/>buildings seems on first<lb/>acquaintance to be a large<lb/>country like town. I think<lb/>it is fairly pretty, and<lb/>at present it has the<lb/>appearance of being a <lb/>very clean town both <lb/>from sanitary and moral<lb/>standpoints. However, I<lb/>fear that it will not<lb/>stay so in the latter respect<lb/>long.</p>
        <p>Went out to camp this<lb/>morning, and found<lb/>that I had been assigned<lb/>to the 317 Machine Gun Bat-<lb/>talion. Didn't like it much<lb/>on first thought, but<lb/>after thinking it over I don't<lb/>know that it makes much<lb/>difference. One's best is<lb/>one's best, just as “pigs is<lb/>pigs,” and the branch of <lb/>the service makes little<lb/>difference in the long run.<lb/>I know nothing about<lb/>it, but guess I can learn.<pb id="umstead11" n="[11]" entity="umstead11"/>Mac Lewis and myself<lb/>are staying in the Pres-<lb/>byterian Theological Seminary<lb/>because we could not<lb/>get room at the hotel. Not<lb/>a bad place to stay at that!</p>
        <p>Met a young preacher<lb/>named Brown. Talked<lb/>philosophy with him a little,<lb/>and found him to be as<lb/>narrow as most preachers<lb/>are in regard to philosophy.</p>

        <p>Came out to camp to stay<lb/>on Monday Sept 3.</p>
        <p>First drafted men<lb/>came in today. Regular<lb/>Duke's mixture as I ex-<lb/>pected. Men from all<lb/>social castes, professions,<lb/>and walks of life, brought<lb/>together for a common<lb/>purpose which many<lb/>of them do not understand.<lb/>It is both pitiful and<lb/>inspiring to look at<lb/>them. God knows they<lb/>have my sympathy espe-<pb id="umstead12" n="[12]" entity="umstead12"/>cially during the first few<lb/>days. Thoughts of loved<lb/>ones; of business left<lb/>behind; the task of adjust-<lb/>ing themselves to a new life,<lb/>new duties, and new<lb/>habits all together at once<lb/>will be hard for them to<lb/>handle.

        <p>Heard from John today<lb/>saying that the district<lb/>board failed to exempt<lb/>him. God only knows what<lb/>Sallie and the child (soon<lb/>children) will do. I have<lb/>worried over it a great<lb/>deal. I can't see how it<lb/>is possible for them to<lb/>fail to exempt him under<lb/>the circumstances. God<lb/>knows he has my sym-<lb/>pathy.

As long<lb/>as I am able, no one else<lb/>shall support his family.<lb/>I can save enough to<lb/>support Sallie &amp; the babies (?)<lb/>I have worked out a<lb/>plan today.

        <p>Sat. afternoon the 15th<lb/>I went to Greensboro<lb/>to see John. Much to my<lb/>pleasure when he met<lb/>me at the Station at 11.20<lb/>he told me he had just<lb/>heard he had been exempt-<lb/>ed. He and I talked late<lb/>into the night. I found<lb/>Sallie doing fine, and<lb/>the little baby, born a<lb/>few days before, was<lb/>doing nicely.</p>
        <p>Sunday morning I<lb/>went out to the Normal to<lb/>see the girls from Kinston<lb/>who I taught last year.<lb/>I saw Hortense Moseley<lb/>Kathleen Moseley, and<lb/>Nannie Stanley. I also<lb/>saw Gladys. They<lb/>seemed glad to see me,<lb/>and I was equally as<lb/>glad to see them. I think<lb/>they were a little home-<lb/>sick but that was nat-<pb id="umstead15" n="[15]" entity="umstead15"/>ural as they had been away<lb/>from home only a week. They<lb/>are fine girls, and will<lb/>make good anywhere.</p>
        <p>I got back here about<lb/>eleven o'clock Sun night.<lb/>Had a tooth pulled Mon-<lb/>day, and found that it<lb/>still hurts in spite of<lb/>painless inventions.</p>

        <p>It has been a good<lb/>while since I have had<lb/>time to write any in this<lb/>book. Things are moving<lb/>on rapidly here. Work on<lb/>the Camp continues, and they<lb/>are rapidly whipping things<lb/>into tip top shape. The second<lb/>increment of drafted men<lb/>are coming in. Our bat-<lb/>talion now has over four<lb/>hundred men in it.</p>
        <p>Got along fine with <lb/>my mess. Saved over $250<lb/>feeding 185 men for 10 days.<lb/>Started Company Messes<lb/>Oct. 2, and now the Messes<lb/>are under direct supervision<lb/>of the company commanders.<lb/>I still draw the rations<lb/>and look after them in<lb/>a general way.</p>
        <p>I am also running our<lb/>Officers Mess, and it is more<lb/>trouble than one would<lb/>imagine. Some men are born <lb/>belly akers or grumblers, and<lb/>of course always find plenty<pb id="umstead17" n="[17]" entity="umstead17"/>to complain at.</p>
        <p>Today I received a<lb/>box of candy from the little<lb/>girls who were in my<lb/>room last year at Kinston.<lb/>No one knows how I appreciated<lb/>it. It touched me deeply to<lb/>think that I was remem-<lb/>bered by so many sweet,<lb/>pure, and lovable souls.<lb/>The following ones sent<lb/>me candy —<list type="simple"><item>Edna Pittman</item><item>Sarah Nochaunson</item><item>Jessie Mae Hoskins</item><item>Elizabeth Brooks</item><item>Mary Eliza Sutton</item><item>Edith Rountree</item><item>Christine Williams</item><item>Arlena Stroud</item><item>Allene Brinkly</item><item>Mildred Elliott</item><item>Hattie Cunningham</item><item>Virginia Smith</item><item>Verna Belle Hoskins</item><item>Grace Wilson</item><item>Gladys Mewborne</item></list></p>

        <p>During the past<pb id="umstead18" n="[18]" entity="umstead18"/>week I received a knit<lb/>sweater from Katherine<lb/>Copeland. She is a very sweet<lb/>girl, and it was certainly<lb/>sweet of her to send me<lb/>a sweater. She was extremely<lb/>nice to me while I was in<lb/>Kinston, and I shall not<lb/>forget her kindness.</p>
        <p>Elizabeth Canady sent me<lb/>a beautiful muffler. One of<lb/>the finest specimens of knit-<lb/>ting I have ever seen. She<lb/>is also a fine girl. Very at-<lb/>tractive and I like her<lb/>very much.</p>
        <p>My friends in Kinston<lb/>have certainly been nice<lb/>to me, and I feel very<lb/>grateful to them for<lb/>their many kindnesses<lb/>to me.</p>

        <p>Went to church last<lb/>night in Columbia, and<lb/>heard a good sermon<lb/>by the Methodist Minister<lb/>A. N. Brunson, taken from<lb/>the tragic death and<lb/>downfall off Sampson, or<lb/>rather his downfall and<lb/>death. Sampson was<pb id="umstead19" n="[19]" entity="umstead19"/>thoughtless for a moment<lb/>and it cost him everything.<lb/><list type="simple"><item>1. Never forget the friends and<lb/>associations of childhood, the<lb/>home and parents which you<lb/>left behind, nor the God which<lb/>your mother taught you to love.</item><item>2.

        <p>It has been some<lb/>time since last I<lb/>opened this book<lb/>for the purpose<lb/>of writing anything.<lb/>I have been very<lb/>busy during the<pb id="umstead20" n="[20]" entity="umstead20"/>time which has elapsed<lb/>since last I wrote,<lb/>and then I have<lb/>not yet learned<lb/>to make the most<lb/>of my spare moments.</p>
        <p>Since Oct. 8 1917<lb/>I have been quite<lb/>well most of the<lb/>time. Have had <lb/>slight colds, and<lb/>was confined to my<lb/>room one day on that<lb/>account. I am<lb/>still acting as<lb/>Mess Officer, and<lb/>do not know when<lb/>I will be relieved<lb/>of it, but sometime<lb/>soon I hope. I have<lb/>proceeded rather<lb/>well with it, but all<lb/>kinds of difficulties<lb/>are constantly<lb/>arising, such as<pb id="umstead21" n="[21]" entity="umstead21"/>cooks, wood, failure<lb/>in deliveries from town,<lb/>unreliable cooks &amp;<lb/>waiters, lack of<lb/>clenliness, and<lb/>worst of all, thinking<lb/>up something to eat.</p>
        <p>I have been holding<lb/>Sunday School class<lb/>in my company on<lb/>Sunday Mornings, and<lb/>I get a great deal<lb/>of help out of it. The<lb/>class sent the Baptist<lb/>Orphanage at Thomas-<lb/>ville, N. Car a check<lb/>for $20 Xmas. A <lb/>fine example of<lb/>helpfulness and<lb/>charity.</p>
        <p>My progress with<lb/>the men who can't read<lb/>and write in the company<lb/>has been rather slow.<lb/>Yet all of them can<pb id="umstead22" n="[22]" entity="umstead22"/>now write their names,<lb/>and can read simple<lb/>sentences very well. I<lb/>hope that I may be able<lb/>to teach them enough to<lb/>break the veil of igno-<lb/>rance so that they can<lb/>add to their intelligence.</p>
        <p>Christmas has come<lb/>and gone, and I can<lb/>hardly realize it. It was<lb/>my good fortune to<lb/>be able to go home<lb/>for a short stay. Got<lb/>there on the morning<lb/>of Dec 23, and had<lb/>to leave on the morn-<lb/>ing of Dec 26. Father<lb/>was sick, and I stayed<lb/>at home with him the<lb/>entire time except<lb/>one afternoon when<lb/>I went over to Durham<lb/>to see if I could hire<lb/>Uncle Henry Harris<pb id="umstead23" n="[23]" entity="umstead23"/>to go out and stay with<lb/>father. I saw him but<lb/>as I had figured, he<lb/>would not go. It hurt<lb/>me to leave home with<lb/>father sick and mother<lb/>feeble with no one<lb/>to help them.</p>

        <p>Yesterday, May 11th, I was<lb/>made B'n supply Officer<lb/>by Maj. Smith. I know<lb/>little about it, but I<lb/>can hold it down by<lb/>working hard.
