        <p>Miss Cameron, in compiling these records, assumed at my request a burden which was rightfully mine.</p>
        <p>I have gone over them carefully, and my first opinion that I had neither the time, patience nor ability to do this work is fully confirmed. At my suggestion, she has made no attempt at narrative, but has faithfully recorded facts. In offering my grateful thanks, I know I voice the sentiment of all those interested in preserving for coming generations Orange County's activities in the World War.</p>

        <p>In accordance with the request of R. D. W. Connor, Secretary North Carolina Historical Commission for the records of the Orange County Council of Defense, and the Council having no valuable records, Mr. J. C. Webb, Chairman of the Orange County Council of Defense, appointed a Historian to keep a record of Orange County's war activities. The following pages are the result of this work. We have made no attempt to write a full narrative history of these two momentous years, but I have merely tried to compile as completely and accurately as possible a skeleton outline of facts and figures concerning Orange County's share in the various activities connected with the Great War from 1917 to 1919. We realize that much of this work is incomplete and inadequate and we ask forgiveness for all deficiencies. We also wish to take this opportunity to thank those who by their hearty co-operation and ready help have made this book possible. Among the names of those to whom our thanks and appreciation are due are the following:</p>

          <head>RED CROSS REPORT, CHAPEL HILL, N. C. CHAPTER.</head>
          <p>Early in February, 1917, Mrs. K. J. Brown, a graduate nurse, at the request of the Chapel Hill Community Club, formed a class in First Aid and Surgical Dressings. This class met for two hour lectures and practical work bi-weekly all during the Spring. Mrs. Brown's excellent work was supplemented by a number of lectures by Chapel Hill and University physicians. Several practical lectures were held in the University Medical Building. As soon as our country declared war on Germany, the class took steps towards the formation of a Red Cross Chapter, and about the same time Dr. Louis H. Webb received instructions from the Director of the Southern District, Dr. Davidson in Atlanta, to organize chapters in the Sixth Medical District of North Carolina. Dr. Webb met with the class and it was unanimously decided to write for an authorization to form a chapter.
<pb id="p4" n="4"/>
While waiting for this authorization a committee composed of Miss Alice Noble, Mrs. P. H. Winston, Mrs. K. J. Brown, Mrs. J. H. Pratt, Mrs. C. S. Mangum, Mrs. W. M. Dey and Mrs. Collier Cobb visited the Raleigh, N. C. Chapter for the purpose of receiving further instructions in Surgical Dressings and other suggestions for chapter success.</p>
          <p>On Monday night, May 28, 1917, Dr. Webb called a meeting of the people of Chapel Hill and Carrboro in the Graded School Building to definitely organize the chapter. There was some discussion about the advisability of forming an auxiliary instead of a chapter, but when the vote was taken almost unanimously it was agreed that the action of the First Aid Class and Dr. Webb should stand. The following officers were elected: Chairman, Dr. George Howe; Vice-Chairman, Miss Alice Noble; Secretary, Miss Nellie Roberson; Treasurer, Mrs. J. H. Pratt (later Mrs. Pratt resigned and Dr. J.M. Bullitt was elected). It was agreed that these officers and three additional members should compose an Executive Committee. The additional members for the Executive Committee were then elected as follows: Mrs. K. J. Brown, Dr. J. M. Bullitt and Mayor W. S. Roberson. The Executive Committee met a few days later in the Mayor's office and elected the following heads for Committees: Woman's Work, Mrs. K. J. Brown; Supplies, Shipments and Headquarters, Miss Alice Noble; Membership, Mrs. C. S. Mangum; Civilian Relief, L. A. Williams; Junior Red Cross, Mrs. W. D. Toy; Finance, Dr. J. M. Bullitt; Medical Instruction, Dr. W. deB. MacNider.</p>
          <pb id="p5" n="5"/>
          <p>By June 18, 1917, all papers for organization had been received, and the Chapter, known as the Chapel Hill, N. C. Chapter with jurisdiction “this side of the railroad”, was busy making Surgical Dressings and doing other work necessary for the winning of the war. The Headquarters and Workrooms for six months were located in a large, well lighted and heated store on Main St. This building, owned by Mayor W. S. Roberson, was generously loaned to the Red Cross. When it was bought by the People's Bank, the members of the Upsilon Chapter of the Zeta Psi fraternity at the University offered the use of the entire lower floor of their fraternity hall, and on January 1, 1918, the Chapter moved to these quarters. These large rooms offer ample space for the Chapter's <sic corr="activities">activites</sic>, and too much cannot be said of the generosity of these young men.</p>
          <p>The membership of the Chapter has grown from the 71 who enrolled at the first meeting to 687 on October 1, 1918.</p>
          <div3 type="Report">
            <head>REPORT FOR WOMAN'S WORK FROM ORGANIZATION OF CHAPTER TO <lb/> NOVEMBER 21, 1918.</head>
            <p>This Chapter, that is this workroom, assisted by the Junior Auxiliary under the direction of Mrs. W. D. Toy and the Country Auxiliary under the direction of Mrs. I. H. Manning, has shipped 44 cases of Red Cross supplies. These supplies include the following:</p>
            <list type="simple">
              <item>100 Comfort Kits</item>
              <item>306 Oakum Pads</item>
              <item>155 Xmas Packages</item>
              <item>18,974 
Gauze Dressings.</item>
              <pb id="p6" n="6"/>
              <item>7685 Miscellaneous Dressings</item>
              <item>495 Hospital Garments</item>
              <item>9 Cases of Belgian Relief Clothing (2,000 lbs).</item>
              <item>453 Knit Articles</item>
            </list>
            <p>On all these supplies we have been given a most excellent rating by Headquarters and have been complimented most highly on the excellent character of the work done. This, of course, shows what a wonderful work the Chapter has done, but by no means indicates what it would like to have done, for the “Allotment and No More” order inaugurated by Headquarters several months ago has been strictly observed.</p>
          </div3>
          <div3 type="finances">
            <head>FINANCES.</head>
            <p>When the Chapter was first organized the Chairman of the Finance Committee, Dr. J. M. Bullitt, immediately began to formulate plans for securing a definite revenue each month for the Treasury. A subscription plan was adopted whereby members make a voluntary pledge for each month towards the maintenance of the workroom, no matter how small the pledge. $150 a month is secured from this source, the income being derived from the subscriptions of sixty-eight members. Others make donations from time to time, so that the full monthly income is considerably larger. Consequently the Chapter has never been compelled to give a benefit of any sort in order to maintain the workroom. When the War Fund drives have been made the Chapter has always responded promptly. In the drive for Red Cross funds in the spring of 1918, Chapel Hill was assessed $500. This assessment was raised in a very short time and before the end of the campaign the pledges totaled $1156.60. This most successful drive was made under the leadership of Dr. J. M. Bell, assisted by Mr. J. S. Holmes.</p>

            <head>JUNIOR RED CROSS</head>
            <p>The Chapel Hill School <sic corr="Auxiliary">Auxilliary</sic> to the Red Cross was organized January, 1918, with a membership of 132.</p>
            <p>During the first months the girls met once a week to work on refugee garments and hospital supplies. Their work resulted in the following articles turned in at the Red Cross Head-quarters:</p>
            <list type="simple">
              <item>Bootees 20 pairs</item>
              <item>Kimonos 2</item>
              <item>Undergarments 30</item>

              <item>Shot Bags 300</item>
            </list>
            <p>Later in the season home gardens were the order of the day. 130 boys and girls undertook to plant and work home gardens. We hope many families profited by the efforts of our boys and girls to increase the country's food supply.</p>
            <p>During the summer, in response to an appeal for clothing for the destitute families of our Allies, we received generous gifts of clothing. A box containing 16 suits for men, practically new, cleaned and pressed, two men's overcoats, and many children's garments was shipped.</p>
            <p>Our boys in the spring, under the direction of Mr. W. W. Rankin, supplied an important need to the Red Cross, viz., shipping boxes made by them in the basement of the school house and sold to the Red Cross at cost.</p>
            <p>They have also been ready at all times to serve in war measures undertaken by the community; the W. S. S. and Food Administration campaigns, and Liberty Loan sales, by distributing circulars, posters, etc.</p>
            <p>In May the School Auxilliary resolved to raise a vacation fund to be turned into the treasury upon the reopening of the school.
<pb id="p8" n="8"/>
On September we went over the top with $103.35 raised by work during vacation. Mr. W. W. Rankin, Treasurer, reported on November 5th $133.10 in the treasury.</p>
            <p>Owing to the closing of the school for five weeks this Fall, the Red Cross activities have ceased for a time, but with the Christmas roll call, when we expect to reach 100% membership, we begin a promising New Year.</p>
            <p>We wish to thank the mothers of Chapel Hill for at all times encouraging our work, and those of our citizens who, by contributions of materials and garments, have given hearty and generous support to the Junior Auxiliary.</p>

This division was organized by the Red Cross in order to compile a list of every woman in the Southern Division who is able, either by experience or training, to nurse the sick. A thorough canvass of Chapel Hill has resulted in the enrolling of eighteen names at the present date.</p>

Manning, have done a most excellent work. This work has consisted largely in the making of hospital shirts, comfort kits, refugee garments, knitted articles, abdominal and triangular bandages. The auxiliaries have furnished a large percentage of the funds for these supplies by the sale of eggs, jelly, apples, benefits and donations of various amounts. The Red Cross allotment system does not furnish sufficient work for the energies of the auxiliaries, so they have also been working for the Mayfair War Relief, an organization formed in Chapel Hill by Mrs. J. S. Holmes in the early days of the war, and other relief societies. It is very hard to separate the work done for the different relief agencies and for this reason the report submitted is a joint one.</p>

            <p>In the early days of the war, Mrs. J. S. Holmes of Chapel Hill organized a French War Relief Circle for the alleviation of war sufferers. Meetings were held once a week and the work of the organization consisted in the making of hospital shirts, garments for refugees, bed pads, triangular bandages, blood wipes, knitted eye bandages, and knitted articles of various kinds. Since this work did not of necessity require the standardizing of the Red Cross, it appealed to the country women, who though in isolated places and places far from any Red Cross rooms, could still do their bit to aid in the great cause of humanity.</p>

            <p>The Community Club early in the summer of 1917 offered its services as an organized body of women to the Government of the United States, through the County Council of Defense, asking that it be used in any way needed for the carrying out of the war. Since then all the activities of the club as a whole have been concerned with the war.</p>
            <p>The Club has assisted the County Food Administrator in the distribution of Federal Food Membership and Kitchen Cards, and the signing of the Food Pledge Cards throughout Chapel Hill Township and village. It has placed hundred of Food Administration bulletins in the homes of town and township.</p>
            <pb id="p15" n="15"/>
            <p>Special meetings have been given to discussions of the food situation, Food <sic corr="Administration">Adminstration</sic> orders, wheat, meat and sugar substitutes, with directions and recipes.</p>
            <p>Last summer the club encouraged gardening and canning with the result that great quantities of food was raised and preserved for winter use. Glass jars and tin cans were bought at wholesale and sold at cost. The club has assisted in the following movements:</p>
            <p>Organization of the Women's Division of the County Council of Defense. Several members including the President were on the Women's Committee.</p>
            <p>The securing of a County Home Demonstrator for Orange County The request met with instant response from the County Commissioners and Board of Education.</p>
            <p>Registration of women as ordered by the General Federation of Women's Clubs.</p>
            <p>Committee from the Club canvassed for both the second and third Liberty Loans. The Club bought two $50 Bonds of the second issue. During the third campaign the committee, with Mrs. T. J. Wilson as chairman, sold $18,600 worth of bonds, of which about $11,000 were taken by Club members. The very efficient county chairman for this campaign was Miss H. M. Berry, first vice-president.</p>
            <p>The Club is actively engaged in the coming campaign for the War Saving and Thrift Stamps.</p>
            <p>Almost every member belongs to the local Red Cross chapter, some being subscribing members.</p>
            <p>The Club assisted in the movement to obtain books for the camp libraries.</p>
            <pb id="p16" n="16"/>
            <p>Miss Jaimeson of the State Normal College, was secured for a demonstration of Victory breads.</p>
            <p>The Club as a whole has been engaged in every phase of war work. It considers that its duty lies in that direction and every effort will be made toward the fullest possible use of the organized woman power of Chapel Hill for that purpose.</p>

            <p>The members of the Woman's Association of the University became interested in war work at the very outbreak of the war, and situated as they were, they had no opportunity to do anything except through the Red Cross. They met once a week during the spring term of 1918 and made bandages, did shipping, and worked with oakum, materials for which were furnished by the local chapter of the Red Cross. This work was all done under the direction of the Red Cross. At the beginning of the college year 1918-19 it was the desire of the Association to do war work, and again its members worked under the direction of the Red Cross, and among other things 150 influenza masks were made. It was decided to make layettes for war relief, to be contributed through the Red Cross, the Association furnishing the materials and doing the work. To raise money for this and other war work a Thanksgiving Peace Celebration was planned, which was in the form of a Gypsy Festival and which was to be held on the campus, but due to rain was held in the Y. M. C. A. The entire building was given over to the Festival, which consisted of different features, such as fortune-telling booths and those selling cakes, candies, salad, sandwiches, oyster stew and other things. The climax of the celebration was a spectacle, “The Triumph of the 20th Century,” held in Gerrard Hall. This depicted
<pb id="p18" n="18"/>
the supremacy of internationalism. From the entire celebration there was realized $350.00, $150.00 of which was contributed to the United War Fund, the remaining $200 to be used for war relief work done by the Association.</p>

              <head>JUNE 5 REGISTRATION.</head>
              <p>For days before Registration Day a Committee from the Red Cross with Miss Alice Hoble as Chairman was busy getting Chapel Hill patriotically decorated for the day on which men all over the United States stood out and said they were ready to give their lives if need be for the cause of right and freedom. Through this committee flags had been purchased, so that from nearly every home in the town Old Glory floated and often with it the flags of our Allies. The Registration Headquarters were also decorated, and as the men registered a committee headed by Mrs. H. W. Chase pinned the khaki bands of honor on their arms. After registration had closed, a great parade was made through the principal streets of the town, headed by the band; next came the newly registered men, and then followed the different organizations of the town.</p>

              <p>At the Summer School of 1917, Dr. C. S. Mangum conducted a class in First Aid, which was largely attended by the Chapel Hill people and the visitors to the village. The class met every day during the entire six weeks of the School, and at the close of the course practical and theoretical examinations were held, the examination questions having been sent from Washington. Dr. Mangum was assisted in the bandage work by two local Red Cross members who had received previous instruction in First Aid.</p>

              <p>Rally Day 1917 stood out conspicuously as a “Win the War Day”. Everywhere the booths in charge of members of the Red Cross emphasized conservation and service as our bit. The men were attracted particularly to the Farm Exhibit. Here garden and farm products of great variety were displayed, all of them raised in this county. The cooking and canning exhibits were perhaps the most practical and interesting displays. Samples of all the war breads,
<pb id="p20" n="20"/>
cakes, preserves, pickles, canned goods, etc., were on exhibit and the ladies in charge showed the visitors to the booth how these delicious things were made. Prizes were awarded for the best exhibits in every department, the judges having been sent here by the State Department of Agriculture, and the money for the prizes being furnished by generous citizens as well as the Department of Agriculture. The Red Cross booth, in a most conspicuous section of the hall, attracted scores of visitors. The women in their picturesque costumes were busy all day making surgical dressings and explaining the different activities of the organization.</p>

              <head>JULY 4th PATRIOTIC CELEBRATION.</head>
              <p>July 4th, 1918, is a day that will long be remembered by the patriotic people of Orange County. In response to the Governor's appeal to the County Council of Defense to make this immortal anniversary of American liberty a day for a great demonstration of patriotism as well as for a renewed pledge to support the cause of our Country and that of our Allies, the Summer School of the University of North Carolina invited Orange County to participate in its celebration. For weeks preparations were made for the event, and when the day for the celebration finally arrived, there assembled the largest representative Orange County crowd on the University campus in all the history of the County. Early in the morning wagons, buggies, and automobiles began to arrive and when the hour for the morning's exercises came, at least three thousand people were on hand. The exercises began with a long parade led by the Liberty Band from Durham and followed by the Orange County Council of Defense and Liberty Loan officials. Then came other patriotic groups such as the Red Cross, Boy Scouts and the school children
<pb id="p21" n="21"/>
(Junior Red Cross). These were followed by groups of members of the Summer School attired in costumes of our Allies and proudly bearing the flags of the brave people they represented. As each group passed they were wildly cheered by the spectators, and when the group representing our own country passed in review the enthusiasm of the crowd knew no bounds. First there was a platoon of United States soldiers (our own University of North Carolina boys in the R. O. T. C) Then North Carolina leading the other States of the Union, and finally, Columbia and Uncle Sam escorted by National Virtues. The procession slowly made its way around the campus until the Flag Pole was reached. Here it halted and the various groups formed a hollow square around the pole, Columbia, Uncle Sam and their guard of honor standing nearest the pole. With the entire audience standing at attention, Columbia assisted by Col. G. W. S. Stevens, the Commanding Officer at the University, and the Boy Scouts, slowly raised Old Glory to the breeze while the hand played the Star Spangled Banner. From the Flag Pole the crowd went to Memorial Hall, where most impressive exercises were held. Hon. S. M. Gattis was the orator for the day, and made a stirring patriotic address.</p>
              <p>Immediately after dinner the Orange County Council of Defense met in Gerrard Hall. Prof. M. C. S. Noble presided over the meeting and made an earnest plea for renewed patriotism and support of the Government. Mr. J. C. Webb, Mr. Strudwick, and others spoke, after which there was an informal discussion of the plans and purposes of the organization. This meeting was followed by a conference of the Chapel Hill Township workers in the War Savings Stamps Campaign. All during the day the Red Cross workers in their picturesque costumes had been busy selling these stamps and at this meeting
<pb id="p22" n="22"/>
it was found that the township had again gone “over the top”.</p>
              <p>At five o'clock a patriotic pageant was held in Battle's Park illustrating the Friendship of France and America. The pageant began with the reception of the Court of Louis XIV in honor of La Salle, who reported on his voyage to the New Continent and interestedly continued to follow the other incidents in our long friendship with France up to that most recent scene in Picpus cemetery when Gen. Pershing laid the wreathe on La Fayette's grave and uttered the now famous words. “La Fayette, we are here!” Just before the closing scene, an scene, Joan of Arc. the Angelus sounded and the large audience bowed their heads while Dr. W. S. Long offered a prayer for our country and our allies.</p>
              <p>In the evening Edward Everett Hale's play, The Man Without a Country, was given in front of the Law Building, the day's exercises thus closing with the note that had been most predominant all day, namely, “Love your Country.”</p>
              <p>Too much praise cannot be given to Prof. A. Vermont, a native Belgian, who worked the plan for the pageant and carried it through with such marked success.</p>

              <head>CAROLINA S. A. T. C. UNIT.</head>
              <p>The following extracts are taken from the October and November (1918) numbers of the Alumni Review:</p>
              <p>“Through the operations of General Order 79 issued by the War Department on August 24th, 1918, the University is operating today, in the main, as a military camp, of which the Students' Army Training Corps unit is the center. Upon this basis the University has converted the campus into a camp, the dormitories into barracks,
<pb id="p23" n="23"/>
the dining hall into a mess hall, and every student inducted into the S. A. T. C. is a soldier under the direct command of Lieut. Col. G. W. S. Stevens and members of his military staff. The faculty, operating under the coordinate educational branch of the service has reorganized its work to conform to the requirements and is offering courses in keeping with the purpose of the War Department. In addition to the S. A. T. C. unit, the University has been designated as one of the 12 institutions in which a marine section of the S. A. T. C. is to be established. A marine officer and non-commissioned officers have been detailed to this institution for the purpose of organizing and instructing such men as may voluntarily apply for induction. It has also been designated as a center for establishing a Naval Section of the S. A. T. C., with a quota of 50 men. The S. A. T. C. unit is composed of four companies of approximately 160 men each, and when arrayed in battalion formation presents a formidable front. Each company is under the direct charge of two lieutenants. Lieut-Col. G. W. S. Stevens, Commandant in Charge since the early summer, has been relieved by the War Department, and Capt. Chas. C. Helmer, a native of Iowa, a graduate of his State University, and a veteran of the Spanish-American War, is now in charge of the Post. Other members of the military faculty include Lieutenants R. F. Boyd, C. P. Rounds, D. G. Lambert, Raymond Martin, Andrew Bell, H. B. Limbaugh, John H. Winslow, C. W. Robinson, P. M. Allison, R. A. Roberts, C. A. Joyce, McCowan, and C. R. Smith, and Sergeant J. S. Stump. The Non-S. A. T. C. students, that is those taking drill but ineligible for the S. A. T. C. either on account of age or physical disabilities, though permitted to room out in town, are under
<pb id="p24" n="24"/>
practically the same rules and regulations as the S. A. T. C. men. Capt. J. Stuart Allen, Director of Military Tactics at the University last year, assisted by Adjutant Whitfield, Professor J. M. Booker, and Student Captain S. C. Ogburn, is in charge of the non-S. A. T. C. company. They are using the old class field for drill grounds.</p>

            <div4 type="section">
              <head>S. A. T. C. INDUCTION.</head>
              <p>“I pledge my allegiance to my flag and the republic for which it stands; one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.” In these solemn words, repeated after President Graham at the flag pole on the campus, 650 University students were formally inducted in an impressive ceremony into the Student Army Corps at noon, October first. At the same moment throughout the entire nation 150,000 representatives of 500 American colleges similarly dedicated themselves to the service of the government in its fight to make the world a safe place in which to live.</p>
              <p>The formal exercises were begun with an invocation by Rev. Euclid McWhorter, followed by the “Star Spangled Banner.” In inducting the students into the Student Army Training Corps, President Graham spoke as follows: “We are met today to re-assert in a spirit of high and solemn consecration our active faith in the principles of freedom, justice and equality, on which this nation was founded, and out of which it has grown in beauty and strength to its present power. We mean to say here today, as our fathers said, and as the wholesome heroic heart of men will always say—that there are certain rights of liberty and life inalienable for men everywhere, and that whenever the vital growth of these rights is menaced we will
<pb id="p25" n="25"/>
be quick to defend them as a heritage more precious than life itself. We are happy today as we accept the sword of defense of these ancient and eternal principles, and more for the opportunity of a wider and deeper interpretation of them, that makes our present cause the equal cause of the liberal brotherhood of all good men everywhere, and makes the cause of our country the common cause of a free mankind. Is it fanciful to think that the heroes of freedom whose stories we have studied here—of Thermopylae, of Runnymede, of Bunker Hill, and the rest—give to us, in the beauty of this quiet spot, their benediction, as we take from their hands the torch of the eternal task and ‘carry on’ to a new and greater victory. The spirit of this campus, the spirit of our State and our country, the spirit of the world today, assure to us the continuing courage and complete devotion that will bring to a glorious <sic corr="fulfillment">fulfilment</sic> the noblest adventure that ever called to the aspiring spirit of youth.”</p>
              <p>In the message from President Wilson, the students were appraised of the significance of the step which they had taken. Other messages were read from Peyton C. March, chief of staff of the United States Army, and Benedict Crowell, acting secretary of war. At the conclusion of the exercises the Corps was reviewed from the steps of the Alumni Building by President Graham, Major Towner (Military Inspector for the South Atlantic States), Colonel Stevens, and members of his staff.</p>
              <p>The custom of asking the soldiers to Sunday dinners, which is followed in cities where regular army camps are located, is being followed in Chapel Hill, the Red Cross co-operating with the Army “Y” in this direction.</p>

            <head>THE INFLUENZA EPIDEMIC.</head>
            <p>Shortly after the opening of the University for the year 1918-19 cases of Spanish influenza began to appear. In a short while scores had been stricken with the disease. In the very first days of the epidemic the Red Cross volunteered its services and began helping the physicians. The co-eds of the University were called upon to make face masks for the doctors and nurses in the various emergency hospitals. Two hundred and eighty-six masks were made, as well as one hundred and seventy arm bands for the attendants in the hospital. For weeks Miss Helen Shell, Miss Katherine Bourne and Mrs. Kent Brown did volunteer nursing in the University hospital, while other women were aiding stricken families all over the village. As the epidemic spread to Carrboro the need for volunteer nurses became more imperative. A committee composed of Misses Josie Pritchard and Helen Shell and Mrs. Kent Brown and Mrs. William deB. MacNider, assisted by others, worked night and day relieving the distressing conditions of the stricken people. Mr. J. S. Carr gave the use of the club rooms for a diet kitchen, paying all expenses for the maintenance of the same. Mrs. R. B. Lawson and Mrs. Arthur Blackwood volunteered to take charge of the kitchen and for two weeks served nourishing meals of soup, bread and milk. At least seven gallons of soup were served daily. Each morning two orderlies visited the various homes of the village to obtain an accurate report of the needs of the people, so that these needs might be supplied. This record would be incomplete without mentioning Miss Roper, who left a remunerative position as nurse for Mrs. McDade and ministered to the University boys afflicted with influenza. Although ill herself, for days she stayed at her post until forced by the physicians to give

up. In a few days pneumonia developed, and this brave woman died, having truly given her life for others.</p>

            <p>On December 1, the Chairman called a meeting of the Executive Committee. Plans for the coming year were discussed and the various committees appointed. Mr. J. S. Holmes, Chairman of the Christmas Roll Call, outlined his plans for the drive. These plans were approved and the Chapter's co-operation promised. Miss Josie Pritchard reported that almost 100 Christmas packages had been sent to American soldiers in France by relatives through the local Red Cross.</p>

Miss Cheshire exhibited and explained sample bandages which she had brought from Raleigh. She advised a mass meeting at an early date to secure more members and to learn more of the Rod Cross and its purpose from a speaker who would address the meeting. June fourth was appointed as the date, in accord with Gov. Bickett's request that patriotic meetings be held before Registration Day, June fifth. The temporary officers elected were Mr. J. C. Webb, Chairman, Miss H. P. Collins, Secretary, Rev. T. M. Grant, Treasurer. Those present joined the Red Cross and became a committee of the whole to obtain new members. The following committees were appointed:</p>

            <p>Prayer by the Rev. T. M. Grant.</p>
            <p>“The Star Spangled Banner” was then sung, after which the Chairman made an address explaining the urgent necessity for the Red Cross. Mr. Edward Bond, a soldier in khaki, who had served all the time our troops were at the Mexican border, made a splendid address, giving the soldier's viewpoint and making a fine object lesson. The “Battle Hymn of the Republic” was followed by a short address by the Rev. A. S. Lawrence, who, as an Englishman, had many friends already in the field and keenly felt the obligation on us to do our share in the Red Cross work. Mr. Frank Nash, in a short but very feeling speech, introduced Mrs. Palmer Jerman, who made a most inspiring address explaining what the Red Cross is and the necessity for America to do her share of that work as well as furnishing soldiers and money for the war. Enrollment of members was the next thing on the programme. Misses Nell Browning, Carrie Spurgeon, Mary Jones, Julia Faucette, Mamie Miller and Della Williams were solicitors. The meeting was closed by singing “Onward Christian Soldiers” and the Benediction pronounced by Rev. Mr. Oldham.</p>

Mr. Webb then stated that a petition had been sent to the National Headquarters for authority to organize the Orange County Chapter of the American Red Cross with jurisdiction over Orange County except Chapel Hill. The written authority to so organize was read by the temporary secretary, Miss Henrietta P. Collins, after which a motion was made to proceed with the organization of the Chapter, which was done by the Chairman appointing the following nominating committee to propose names for permanent officers: Dr. Spurgeon. Mr. N. W. Brown, Mrs. Strudwick, Miss Sarah Webb and Mrs. R. B. Hayes.</p>
            <p>“The Star Spangled Banner” was sung, then the nominating committee made the following report: For Chairman, Maj. John W. Graham; Vice Chairman, Mr. J. B.

A thorough canvass of Hillsboro was to be made and two or more classes started. The committee consisted of Miss Hayes, Mrs. Johnston, Mrs. Robertson, Mrs. A. J. Warren, and Mrs. Oldham. The branch at Cedar Grove was to be asked to supply or make from ten to twenty-five sets.</p>

            <p>At the regular meeting of the Red Cross Executive Committee on July 1, 1918, Miss Forrest read her financial report for June, which showed a balance in bank of $95.95. Seven renewals and four new members were reported this month.</p>
            <p>At a called meeting of the Executive Committee of the Red Cross held on July 19, Major Graham made a motion that, in answer to Mr. James H.

<pb id="p40" n="40"/>
through Raleigh in the name of the Orange County Chapter, which was carried.</p>
            <p>The receipt of the Chapter box for June, to Headquarters, was reported. It contained 8000 compresses which were sent direct to France without repacking.</p>
            <p>At the monthly meeting of the Red Cross Executive Committee held at the Red Cross Room, August 12, a letter from Headquarters advising discontinuing the donating of comfort kits to our county men when they leave for camp, was read. The men are furnished with most of the contents immediately on reaching camp, and the use of the khaki for this purpose made too large a demand on the supply. A motion was made that the comfort kit activity be determined by a committee composed of Mrs. Strudwick and Miss Collins, who were to consult with the comfort kit committee about supplies on hand and decide just when to discontinue giving them. A petition from Carr precinct to become a Branch of the Orange County Chapter A. R. C. was granted. Also a request for permission to give an evening of song for the benefit of the Red Cross by the Hillsboro Community Chorus was gratefully accorded. A letter was read asking that Junior Red Cross work be organized early in the school year. Thirty one magazine subscriptions were reported.

            <p>At the regular meeting of the Executive Committee of the Orange County Chapter A. R. C., a motion was carried that the Comfort Kit Committee continue the gift of articles on hand until they are all used. The Canteen Committee composed of Mrs. Forrest,
<pb id="p41" n="41"/>
Miss Bessie Kirkland, Mrs. Johnson, Miss Hamilton, Miss Collins, with five additional ladies of their selection, were given authority to purchase such supplies as they deem necessary for the packages to be given the boys going to camp, the value of each package not to exceed the sum of one dollar. Miss Forrest. Treasurer, reported the August expenditures to amount to $707.75, leaving a balance in bank of $308.71. A gift of the Community Chorus of $73.00 was reported and Mrs. H. N. Webb moved that the Director of the Community Chorus be sent a note of thanks for the gift resulting from the evening of song.</p>
            <p>At a regular meeting of the Orange County Chapter Executive Committee it was decided to borrow $200.00 for sixty days to meet indebtedness at Headquarters and other expenses. The allotments which had been sent the chapter were discussed and the irrigation pads accepted but the allotment for garments was to be delayed for a month at least.</p>
            <p>At a meeting of the Executive Committee called January 21, 1919, it was decided to sell the gauze and yarn on hand. It was voted for Mrs. W. H. Webb, Purchasing Agent, to try to find a sale for the gauze and for Mrs. Robertson to turn over the yarn to Miss Forrest, who is to hold it open for sale until March 1, 1919. What is left at that time is to be sold in lump.</p>

                <p>On June 28, 1917, Mr. J. Cheshire Webb, of Hillsboro, received his appointment as Chairman of the Orange County Council of Defense, which he was to organize. In order to accomplish the expansion of county organization by the creation of Community Councils, he called a meeting at the court house June 15, 1918, to be attended by those named for the Community Councils. At this meeting Mr. Webb outlined the origin and function of the Council of Defense as follows:</p>
                <p>“When the United States entered the war, Congress felt the necessity of uniting and expediting all the measures for the preparation and continuance in the war. To this end it created a National Council of Defense and charged this body with manifold duties. The Council is composed of six members of the President's Cabinet: The Secretary of War is President and the other members
<pb id="p46" n="46"/>
are Secretary of Navy, Secretary of Agriculture, Secretary of Interior, Secretary of Commerce and Secretary of Labor. This is the National Council of Defense. Then the National Council in turn created the State Councils and it says of the State Councils: ‘The State Councils of Defense should co-operate with each other and with the Federal Government in organizing and directing the resources of the State in men and materials to make them available and effective for national use and should recommend changes in the State laws which may become expedient. Acting under authority of law, the National Council of Defense has asked the Governors of each State to form a State Council of Defense to accomplish the services mentioned.’ In compliance with this request the Governor of North Carolina has appointed a State Council of Defense, of which the Governor and Adjutant-General are ex officio members. The other members are as follows: Mr. W. S. Lee, Mr. C. C. Taylor, Dr. Joseph Hyde Pratt, Dr. James Sprunt, Col. J. Bryan Grimes, Mr. Geo. Watts, Mr. R. N. Page, Mr. F. L. Seely, Dr. George Howe, Mrs. J. E. Reilley, and Dr. D. H. Hill. Dr. D. H. Hill of Raleigh was elected State Chairman. The State Council in its turn formed County Councils in each of the 100 counties in the State. This Council is composed of a chairman and six members. This is known as the central committee. In Orange County they are: M. C. S. Moble, C. H. Robertson, S. Strudwick, S. W. Andrews, John P. Hughes, P. C. Collins and J. C. Webb (Chairman). President Wilson now sanctions and urges a movement to extend this Council into every community in the entire nation, and to perfect this organization in Orange County is our reason for being here today. The following named gentlemen have been named to fill the place in
<pb id="p47" n="47"/>
their respective T.P.'s, for the Central Council decided that it was best to make the unit of organization the township rather than the school district. As to the duties which you will have to perform, I can simply say this, that as near as I can make out, the function of this council at present is to do everything possible to <hi rend="underline">Win the War.</hi> Our duties are nicely divided into such heads as these: Finance, Legal, Co-ordination work, Sanitation, etc. The Council has little or no funds in this State, but in spite of this it has accomplished no little. It is largely responsible for the creation of the N. C. State Reserve militia. It is also responsible in a great measure for the successful work of the Food Administration and registration of soldiers. As yet the people at large have no clear conception of just what is and will be expected of us. Your chairman has been asked to do everything from getting a soldier a divorce to catching a deserter. He thought this stretching the duties of his office. But as said before, we must stand prepared to do anything in our power to help win the war. You will be a permanent committee from now until God gives us the victory, to co-operate with every kind of war activity, whether it be selling War Stamps, working for the Red Cross or Y. M. C. A., or giving comfort or relief to members of a soldier's family. Remember that our duty is to co-operate but never to interfere with any other committee. And under no condition must we form any other kind of organization, but must endeavor to bind together for the most effective work those already existing.”</p>

          </p>
          <p>The Woman's Committee of the Council of National Defense was organized in Orange County on August 1st, 1997, at the court house in Hillsboro. About fifty women were present, representing every organization of women in the county. The meeting was called by Mrs. J. Cheshire Webb, who had previously received appointment as temporary County Chairman, with instructions to call a meeting to
<pb id="p49" n="49"/>
perfect a permanent organization. The election of officers resulted as follows: Chairman, Mrs. J. Cheshire Webb, Hillsboro; Secretary, Miss Lula Cassidy, Hillsboro; Treasurer, Mrs. Isaac Manning, Chapel Hill.</p>
          <p>The objects and aims of the organization were cited by the Chairman, being mainly to coordinate and link together all existing organizations of women, in order to secure greater efficiency in defense work for the nation.</p>
          <p>It was decided at this meeting to organize throughout the county in units, as suggested by the State Committee—a unit for each township—the organization to follow the plan for the county, i.e. a chairman, secretary and treasurer and head of each department of activity.</p>
          <p>On Labor Day, 1917, the second meeting of the Woman's Committee was held at the court house in Hillsboro. The resignation of Miss Cassidy as secretary was accepted, as she was planning soon to leave the county. Miss Sue Hayes was elected in her place.</p>
          <p>Upon deliberate consideration the vote of the meeting of August first was cancelled and a central organization was unanimously agreed upon, with the heads of departments as follows, representing women from all parts of the county:</p>
          <list type="simple">
            <item>1. Registration of Women for Service, Mrs. W. L. Wall, Hillsboro.</item>
            <item>2. Food Production, Miss Hallie Kirkland, Hillsboro.</item>

            <item>11. Educational Propaganda, Miss Harriet Bowen, Chapel Hill.</item>
          </list>
          <p>Miss H. M. Berry, Chapel Hill, was appointed Chairman of the Committee on Finance, and Mrs. Shepperd Strudwick, Hillsboro, Chairman of Publicity.</p>
          <p>The following ladies constitute the Central Committee, taken together with the county officers and heads of department named above: Mrs. H. W. Chase, Chapel Hill, Miss Rebecca Cameron, Hillsboro, Miss Alice Noble, Chapel Hill, Mrs. J. S. Holmes, Chapel Hill, Mrs. W. H. Webb, Hillsboro, Mrs. T. N. Webb, Hillsboro.</p>
          <p>Mrs. L. C. Patterson was unable to accept the appointment as head of Liberty Loan Committee, and Mrs. James H. Webb was appointed in her place, and served for the Second Liberty Loan drive. Upon the resignation of Mrs. Webb, Miss H. M. Berry was named as chairman and served for the Third and Fourth Liberty Loan drives. Figures giving the results of these drives are recorded elsewhere.</p>
          <p>The State Committee asked each county committee to help finance the State work by contributing $2.00 a month. Money was raised for this purpose by individual subscription and contributions from the different organizations of women in the county, which more than paid our obligation from August 1, 1917, to August 1, 1918. In August 1918, the Commissioners of Orange County made an appropriation of $24.00 to cover our dues to the State Committee for the year following, and this amount was gratefully acknowledged by the County Chairman and forwarded by our Treasurer to the State Treasurer.</p>
          <p>The Registration of Women for Service was held in
<pb id="p51" n="51"/>
October, 1917, at which time over two hundred women filled out and signed the service cards provided for that purpose.</p>
          <p>In July 1918, a canvass of the county was made in the interest of the U. S. Student Nurse Reserve, with the result that eight young women enrolled, six white, and two colored.</p>
          <p>In February, 1919, in response to a letter to Governor Bickett asking his advice about carrying on the work of the Woman's Committee, he states that the Legislature seems indisposed to make any appropriation to carry on the work of the Council of Defense, because the General Assembly feels that present necessities of the State institutions should be taken care of before any extra work is assumed. Under these circumstances he does not feel that we are justified in incurring any further personal expense in this connection. Besides this, it is thought that Woman's Work will be taken up by organized effort in other directions. Not wishing to duplicate work, or endeavor to do work which does not mean real service, our organization naturally vanishes. On February 15, 1919, our State Chairman issued an honorable discharge to all members of the Woman's Committee of the Council of National Defense.</p>

      <div1 type="Food Administration">
        <head>FOOD ADMINISTRATION</head>
        <p>No single thing showed the patriotic spirit of the people of Orange County during the war more than the cheerful way in which they carried out the irksome rules and regulations of the Food Administration. A word must also be said for the merchants and the millers of the county. There was no wilful violation of a single rule by any mill in the county, and in only two instances
<pb id="p52" n="52"/>
did a merchant break over, and in these cases they were of so mild a nature that they were settled by the County Administrator.</p>
        <p>The housekeepers were industrious in saving all the fruits and vegetables by methods of canning and drying. Never has there been so much effort and accomplishment in this direction. The State offices at Raleigh will record all the various orders that were issued to the counties, so it is useless to name them here. There was, however, one rule originated by the Orange County Food Administrator which might be mentioned, namely, the order forbidding the threshing of wheat before the 15th of July. In spite of the fact that this order was issued at the request of the Farmers' Union and with the consent of the threshermen of the county, when the usual time came round for threshing to begin there was a very natural feeling of unrest on the part of the farmer who had his wheat out in the weather, but by this time so accustomed had the people become to obeying all rules that in spite of the great temptation in only two cases was there violation. These violators plead guilty and voluntarily contributed to the Red Cross, and the cases against them were dropped.</p>
        <p>Orange County having two large towns, it was necessary to have an Administrator at Chapel Hill. Mr. R. A. Eubanks was appointed for this place and did good and faithful work.</p>
        <p>On September 20, 1917, Mr. Henry A. Page, State Food Administrator, appointed Mr. J. Cheshire Webb, of Hillsboro, the Food Administrator for Orange County. The Executive Committee of the County Food Administration was as follows: Prof. E. C. Branson, Chapel Hill; Mrs. Isaac Manning, Chapel Hill; Mrs. H. W. Chase,
<pb id="p53" n="53"/>
Chapel Hill; Mr. Lueco Lloyd, Chapel Hill; County Farm Demonstrator, Hillsboro; Mrs. J. C. Webb, (Ch'm. Woman's Div. Council of Defense). Hillsboro; Mrs. G. C. Roberts, Hillsboro, RFD #1; Mr. R. H. Claytor, Supt. of Pub. Inst., Hillsboro.</p>
        <p>On October 13, 1917, a meeting of Teachers and School Committeemen, called by Mr. J. C. Webb, through the office of the County Superintendent of Public Instruction, was held in the court house. Responding to the call, forty-two teachers and a goodly number of committeemen and citizens assembled at the court house at eleven o'clock. The object of the meeting was to impress the teachers with the importance of the Food Conservation Campaign to be held October 29—November 4, and to explain to them the part which they were to do to make it a success. Prof. Branson of the University, in a very able address, explained the importance of food conservation and Mrs. Isaac Manning of Chapel Hill presented a most interesting account of her “Third Line of Defense” work in the southern end of the county.</p>
        <p>At this meeting plans were laid for registering, at her respective school house, every woman in every school district on October 27, 1917. At this time each woman was to sign the Food Pledge, thus showing her willingness to co-operate in every way possible with the Food Administration. Those who failed to sign the pledge on that day were to be visited individually. These plans were carried out. The school houses were kept open from 9:00 A. M. to 4: P. M. on Saturday, October 27, 1917, and the various committees were on hand in their respective school houses to attend to the registration. During the following week, October 29 -
<pb id="p54" n="54"/>
November 4, a systematic canvass was made of each School District and every housewife was personally interviewed.</p>

We prefer that because if machines did not start before the 20th, grain would not be all threshed before tobacco was ripe and need curing and cultivation is practically finished usually by July 15.</p>

                <p>Whereas it is customary for threshing machines in Orange County to start about July 1, which causes the cultivation of crops to be neglected and, in our opinion, yield reduced, now, therefore</p>
                <pb id="p58" n="58"/>
                <p>Resolved, that we the representatives of the Local Farmers' Union of Orange County in convention at Schley, N. C., March 30, 1918, favor a rule by the Food Administration that no threshing machine be allowed to start this year before July 15.</p>

        <p>In response to a proclamation of Governor Bickett on September 23rd, 1917, the Council of Defense of Orange County met on October 20th 1917, by a call from Chairman J. C. Webb, and selected twenty-five men to comprise a detachment of a composite company of State Militia. These men were invited to meet at the court house at Hillsboro on October 22, and October 24, 1917, and in response to this invitation the following men met and voluntarily enlisted for the “duration of the war.”</p>

        <head>WAR SAVINGS CAMPAIGN.</head>
        <p>Orange County's entire quota of War Savings Stamps was three hundred and thirty-one thousand and four hundred dollars worth ($331,400.00) or an average of $20.00 for every individual in the county. In a War Savings drive June 23-28, 1918, seventy-five per cent of this quota was pledged. In order to raise the other twenty-five per cent another War Savings drive was held September 9-14, 1918.</p>
        <p>On Registration Day, September 12, 1918, a large War Savings Rally was hold at the court house at 9:00 P. M. On account of the illness of Mr. S. Strudwick, Chairman of the Committee, the meeting was presided over by Mr. Gattis. An enormous crowd packed the court house and the hallway and stairs, for besides the interest in War Stamps there was the added attraction, not only of two of Pershing's men back from France, but one of our own boys, Mr. Jim Cheshire, who was the first to volunteer from this town and who has been sent home to train troops, having been made unfit by wounds for active service at the Front.</p>
        <p>The meeting was opened by the singing of the “Star Spangled Banner” by the Community Chorus, followed by a prayer by Rev. Mr. Oldham. Mr. J. Cheshire Webb then made an announcement as to the need of more War Stamps being sold. After the Chorus had sung “God

Save the King”. Mr. Gattis introduced Private Higgins of the Mass. Guard, who gave a most interesting account of his experiences in the trenches. He was just recovering from a severe gassing. Following this address the Chorus sang “Sons of America”, after which Mr. Cheshire was introduced amid a storm of applause. He is the first of our own men to come back and he was given a regular ovation. He gave a most interesting account of his experiences, particularly praising the splendid work of the Red Cross. The meeting was closed with the singing of the “Marseillaise” by the Chorus.</p>

                  <p>The banks have not made their final report to Mr. Brown. It looks as if the subscription through the banks of the county will be about $119,000.</p>
                  <p>Certain subscriptions through banks outside the county which ought to be credited to this county will run the subscription to about $130,000.</p>
                  <p>The total allotment for the county was $112,500. I think the banks have several days yet to finish making their report. When the final reports are all in, I will give you the result.</p>

<salute>Mrs. John A. Long, State Chairman, <lb/> Woman's Liberty Loan Committee, <lb/> Kinston, N. C.</salute>
<salute>My dear Mrs. Long:</salute></opener>
                  <p>I have to make the following report for the Woman's Committee for Orange County.</p>
                  <p>There was obtained by direct solicitation of the women $67,300 from 79 men and 56 women. I worked with the Chairman for men in sending out two circular letters and various literature to every tax payer in the county. Just what was the direct result of this, I am unable to say, but I believe it should add at least $10,000 to the amount obtained by the Woman's Committee, which would make $77,300. So far as we are able to get the figures from the banks at the present time, the county has subscribed a little over $131,000, which is twenty per cent over our quota of $112,500. It may be said then that the Woman's Committee obtained 5/7 of the county's quota, and 8/13 of the bonds sold in the county.</p>
                  <p>Trusting this will give you the information desired, I am</p>

        <p>A Y. M. C. A. drive was held November 11-19, 1917. Orange County's quota was $200.00. The Committee for raising this money was composed of the following gentlemen: N. W. Brown, G. K. Collins, and T. M. Grant. On Sunday, November 11, at 7:30 P. M. at the Methodist Church. Mr. George E. Dey, M. A. from Camp Green, Charlotte, delivered an address in which he explained the great need of the Y. M. C. A. and outlined the work that it did.</p>
        <p>On Sunday, November 18, at 3 P. M. a grand Y. M. C. A. Rally was held at the court house. Such a large crowd attended that even all standing room was taken and many crowded about the halls and staircases. Maj. John W. Graham presided. The meeting was opened by Scripture lesson and prayer offered by Dr. Benton, rector of St. Matthews Church, after which Rev. G. H. Allen, Army Y. M. C. A. Secretary at Camp Greene, Charlotte, made an address, telling of the Y. M. C. A. work at the training camps. At the close of this address, Hon. S. M. Gattis outlined briefly what the county was doing for the boys. He commended the local committee for the effective manner in which they were handling the campaign. After hearing the reports from various committees from schools, churches, etc., the total amounted to $1,400.00. The rest of the $2,000.00 was subsequently raised, although Orange County was credited with only $18,000.00, as through some mistake about $200.00 from the Chapel Hill community was credited to another county.</p>
        <p>On Thursday night, September 19, 1918, a meeting was held in the court house at Hillsboro for the purpose of organizing

Orange for the coming United War Work drive. The meeting was opened with the singing of the Star Spangled Banner by the Community Chorus, followed by a prayer by Rev. Mr. Oldham. The Chorus then sang the “Song of a Thousand Years”, after which Hon. S. M. Gattis introduced the speaker of the evening, Mr. Will Erwin of Durham. Mr. Erwin delivered an address on the Y. M. C. A. and the great need to support it. At the close of the address he requested that the county be organized for work in the coming drive. The following nominating committee was appointed: Miss Henrietta P. Collins, Mr. G. K. Collins, Rev. Mr. Oldham, Mr. N. W. Brown. While the nominating committee were consulting, Mr. Warner, a Y. M. C. A. worker from Durham, gave an account of the work among the soldiers. The nominating committee then returned with the following report.</p>

        <head>EPIDEMIC OF SPANISH INFLUENZA.</head>
        <p>Early in October, 1918, Dr. D. H. Hill, State Chairman of the Council of Defense, sent letters to all County Chairmen warning them of the spread of Spanish influenza, which was threatening the whole country. In this letter he made suggestions as to what steps should be taken, etc.</p>
        <p>In accordance with this, Mr. J. C. Webb called a meeting of the representative men to meet with the County Commissioners and plans were made for Relief Work. It was realized at this meeting that there was no County Board of Health, and so one was created, with Dr. Spoon of Hillsboro as County Health Officer, who with the following constitute the Board of Health: Dr. B. B. Lloyd; Ed N. Cates Chmn. Co. Board of Commissioners; Jeff Turner, Mayor of Hillsboro; R. H. Claytor, County Supt. of Schools.</p>
        <p>Mr. T. N. Webb was appointed County Chairman of the Relief Work, with Dr. J. S. Spurgeon to represent the Hillsboro School District. The other districts were as follows:</p>
        <list type="simple">
          <item>Mr. Sterling Browning, representing the Eno District.</item>
          <item>Mr. Carl Forrest, representing the Efland District.</item>
          <item>Mr. John P. Hughes, representing the Cedar Grove District.</item>
          <item>Mr. Eubanks, representing the Chapel Hill District.</item>
        </list>
        <p>Rev. Harvey Bradshaw was appointed to have charge of the town of Hillsboro and Mr. C. H. Robertson that of West End.</p>
        <p>On October 7, the Board of Health ordered the closing of all churches, schools, theatres, etc., and forbade all meetings of every kind, in order to prevent, if possible, a spread of the disease which had already broken out in the community.
<pb id="p76" n="76"/>
With the appearance of the first case, assistance was given in nursing and furnishing suitable nourishment and necessities by citizens of the town, and Dr. Spurgeon's family, Rev. Mr. Bradshaw, Miss Nellie Russell, and Mr. Chester Turner were among the first to render aid and continued to do all in their power.</p>
        <p>When the epidemic spread to the Eno Mill district, the officials of the mill opened a diet kitchen at the West Hill school, and financed it for about seven weeks. Miss Elizabeth Cornelius, Home Demonstration Agent, was placed in charge of this undertaking and proved herself most efficient and faithful throughout the long siege. Without her it could not have been accomplished. Mr. C. H. Robertson supervised this work and rendered every assistance possible, and as chairman of West Hill was untiring in his efforts to do everything in his power. Misses Emma Robertson and Mildred Durham were Miss Cornelius' assistants during the entire time and Miss Rebecca Wall also rendered valuable aid for several weeks. As many as 150 people were fed daily for some time, and an average of 90 for most of the time. Not only the sick were furnished with nourishment, but the families with no one to cook or provide for them were furnished with the proper diet. Mrs. Emerson and Miss Allie Graham were secured by the Mill to do nursing, and Miss Duncan, the deaconess at the Mills, with these two, rendered most valuable service and gave unstintingly of their time and strength. After preparing the nourishment the ladies at the diet kitchen went with the nurses to deliver it where it was needed.</p>
        <p>Eno Mill also secured another trained nurse, Miss Whitfield, and Bellevue Mill secured Miss Smith from Durham. Mr.

Chester Turner and Ross Turner (colored) did noble service as volunteer nurses wherever the need arose.</p>
        <p>As County Chairman, Mr. T. H. Webb was most active and efficient and untiring in his labors, and was especially helpful when the need was great in the Bellevue district. He and Mrs. Webb sent food and clothing to those in need.</p>
        <p>Rev. Mr. Bradshaw worked long and faithfully when the epidemic extended into the town, collecting and delivering nourishment furnished and made by ladies throughout the town. He was assisted in this by Mrs. J. C. Webb driving him to the homes where he had to go, and when it was impossible for Mrs. Webb to continue, a car and driver were furnished by Mr. J. C. Webb for this purpose until the epidemic was past.</p>
        <p>As soon as the need for nurses was felt, Miss Henrietta Collins volunteered to go wherever needed, and later Miss Virgie Cole volunteered, but they were not called upon to serve.</p>
        <p>The Relief Work was organized and carried on by the County Board of Health, but most if not all workers were members of the Red Cross. Below are the minutes of a meeting held in connection with this work.</p>
        <q direct="unspecified">
          <p>A special meeting of the Executive Committee of the Red Cross was held October 26th, at 10:00 o'clock in Major Graham's office. There were present Major Graham, Mr. Robertson, Mrs. J. C. Webb, Mrs. W. H. Webb, Mr. T. N. Webb, Mr. N. W. Brown, Miss H. P. Collins, Mr. Bradshaw and Dr. Spurgeon. This meeting was for the purpose of co-operating with the Committee for the Relief of the Influenza Epidemic, of which committee Mr. T. N. Webb is County Chairman. A motion was carried that there be appointed a chairman of a Nursing Committee of each of the two school districts to whom application may be made for nurses to serve anywhere in our jurisdiction, a record of volunteers to be reported to the Secretary, who was to keep it. Mr. T. N. Webb was appointed Chairman of this Committee for the West Hill School District and Miss Russell for the Hillsboro District.</p>

        <pb id="p78" n="78"/>
        <p>A canvass of the town was made the day of this Red Cross meeting to tell the people of the need for nurses and to ask for volunteers who might be called upon if necessary. The Red Cross was asked to furnish gauze face masks and this work was done at the work room as long as a supply was needed.</p>
        <p>The ladies of the Red Cross were asked to make garments for the sick in emergency cases, and this was gladly done at a moment's notice. People were very generous in furnishing butter-milk and soup not only those in town but a quantity of milk was furnished by people out of town, especially east of town. The Rev. Mr. Hester, Mr. and Mrs. C. H. Robertson, and Mrs. J. C. Webb alternatively collected this milk for use at West Hill and in town. Among those who helped by serving or furnishing nourishment are:</p>

        <head>THE COMMUNITY CHORUS.</head>
        <p>The Hillsboro Community Chorus was formally organized at the Hillsboro Library on Monday evening September 2nd, 1918, with the following officers: Mrs. W. D. Benton, Director; Mrs. Shepherd Strudwick, Accompanist; Mrs. Norfleet Webb, President; Mrs. Allen Browning, Vice-President; Mrs. Grover Bivins, Secretary. It was decided to meet at the court house every Thursday evening at 8:00 o'clock. Mrs. Norfleet Webb offered the use of her piano for the duration of the war and her offer was gladly accepted.</p>
        <p>The Community Chorus was in existence for some time before its formal organization and sang patriotic songs at all the public meetings, gatherings, etc. On August, 1918, a concert was given and the proceeds, amounting to $73.00, were given to the local Red Cross Chapter. On account of the epidemic of Spanish influenza the Chorus did not meet from October till January. Then one meeting was held in the High School building, but on account of a second outbreak of the epidemic no more meetings were held until March. It was decided to have the High School as the permanent meeting place. The Chorus has planned to give four concerts a year and give the money to the Daughters of the Confederacy to help erect a Public Library as a memorial to the Orange County Confederate soldiers. The Community Chorus has over fifty members.</p>

        <p>Orange County had a certain number of deserters and slackers and it was intended that their names should be recorded here, but owing to the impossibility of gaining absolutely correct information we feel that such action would be both unwise and unfair, incurring the risk of bringing undeserved disgrace upon innocent men.</p>

        <p>At the request of the Chairman of the Celebration for the returned soldiers, Mr. C. H. Robertson, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Red Cross, called a meeting of the Red Cross Executive Committee and other representative workers in the Red Cross at the court house on June 20, 1919, at six o'clock. After the meeting was called to order the chairman asked Mr. Webb to explain the purpose of the meeting, which was to enlist the help of the ladies of the Red Cross in decorating the town and in serving the dinner of the soldiers on July 16, 1919. He made known the plans for the day and all expressed themselves as most anxious to do everything possible for the success of the day. Mr. Robertson then appointed Mrs. W. L. Wall as chairman for the dinner, with power to select as many assistants as she wished. The following were selected to assist Mrs. Wall;</p>

          </opener>
          <p>July 16th, 1919, will long be remembered as the biggest day Orange County has ever seen. Long weeks of planning, working and preparing culminated that day in a celebration of which the people of Hillsboro and of Orange County may well be proud. Early in the morning automobiles, carriages, buggies and wagons began streaming into town and soon side streets and vacant lots were lined with machines, horses, mules and vehicles of all kinds, and streets and squares were thronged with eager, happy crowds gathered to welcome home again from battle-field and training camp the brave young soldiers and sailors of Orange County. Streets and public buildings, stores and houses had been beautifully decorated with flags and bunting and “Welcome” banners which filled the town with bright colors and added greatly to the beauty of the scene. The towns of Durham and Chapel Hill most generously lent all their flags and decoration supplies and did all in their power to help supply the necessary material. Every care had been taken by the people of the town to provide for the comfort of their guests. At intervals along the streets were placed barrels of ice water and lemonade booths, and two rest rooms were provided for the ladies, one at the Masonic Lodge and one at the Hillsboro Commercial Club.</p>
          <p>The Committee on arrangements expected fifteen thousand people and the crowd fully realized their expectations. Visitors came not only from all the surrounding country, but also from the towns of Chapel Hill, Durham and Raleigh. The exercises of the day were opened by a parade which formed at the Baptist Church and marched to the Court House in the following order:</p>
          <list type="simple">
            <item>Confederate Veterans,</item>
            <pb id="p113" n="113"/>
            <item>Red Cross Workers,</item>
            <item>Boy Scouts,</item>

            <item>Colored soldiers and sailors,</item>
            <item>Colored Red Cross Workers.</item>
          </list>
          <p>The Governor was escorted to the speaker's stand by Gen. J. S. Carr and a representative company of the Confederate Veterans.</p>
          <p>Immediately after the parade the crowd gathered about the court house square to hear the Governor's address. The address of welcome was delivered by Hon. Frank Nash in behalf of the Mayor, immediately following which Governor Bickett was introduced by Major John W. Graham. The Governor delivered a splendid address.</p>
          <p>Immediately following the Governor's address the crowd adjourned to Cameron Park, where dinner was served to the men in uniform, Confederate Veterans, Boy Scouts, Summer School students taking part in the play, and the Governor's party, and other official guests. The dinner consisted of fried chicken, ham and rolls, pickle, sliced bread, barbecue, coca-cola, ice-cream and cake, and owing to the efficiency and untiring efforts of the ladies in charge it proved a great success. Fully a thousand guests were served. Hon. S. M. Gattis was toastmaster, and at the close of the dinner ten-minute talks were made by Gen. J. S. Carr, Col. Sidney Minor, Col. Don Scott. Col. J. H. Pratt, Maj. L. P. McLendon and Capt. Sandy Graham. Dinner was served to the colored soldiers and sailors at the colored school house. The hams and chickens for both dinners were contributed by the people throughout the surrounding country and were prepared and cooked by the ladies of the town.</p>
          <p>At four o'clock in the afternoon the play “Esther Wake” was to be given at Cameron Park by students of the University of
<pb id="p114" n="114"/>
North Carolina Summer School, under the direction of Mr. Adolph Vermont, who himself wrote the play which represents scenes from the early history of Hillsboro and Orange County. Long before the appointed time the hillside facing the natural stage was covered with a crowd of over five thousand people eagerly awaiting the beginning of the performance, which took place immediately after an introductory address by Mr. Albert Coates of Chapel Hill and a few words by Mr. Vermont. The play, which is itself a fine piece of work, was splendidly acted, the costumes were beautiful and the scenes most interesting, so that it was a great regret and disappointment to all when a heavy thunder storm interrupted the second act and continued with such violence that it was impossible to go on with the play.</p>
          <p>But in spite of the inclement weather, at its close the day was considered by all a splendid success and will long be a bright spot in the memory of those who had the pleasure of taking part in it. A committee under Mr. S. Strudwick served as special police and traffic managers for the day, and it may be said that no crowd could have been more generally good-natured, quiet and well-behaved than that which attended the celebration. We feel that this account would be incomplete without a few words of thanks and appreciation for those who have made this celebration possible. Chief among these is Mr. J. C. Webb, Chairman of the Orange County Council of Defense, to whose anergetic, efficient and untiring efforts is largely due the success of the day. But he was not alone. Chairmen of committees, committees themselves, workers and helpers of all kinds together with loyal citizens throughout the county gave unstintingly of their time and energy,
<pb id="p115" n="115"/>
as well as of their goods and substance, for the success of the occasion. It was an undertaking close to the hearts of all the people, in which all heartily co-operated and in which all thoroughly proved their generosity and their ability. So popular was this movement that the funds for expenses were largely oversubscribed.</p>

      <div1 type="Chapel Hill Celebration">
        <head>HOME COMING CELEBRATION IN CHAPEL HILL.</head>
        <p>One of the greatest patriotic celebrations ever staged in Chapel Hill took place Saturday, May 10th, 1919, honoring the young and old veterans of the surrounding country. It was a big success. Chapel Hill citizens demonstrated their ability in doing things in this grand celebration. They simply outdid themselves and they deserve the praise they are receiving from all sides. Despite the lowering clouds, which threatened rain early in the day, and kept many families from coming to Chapel Hill, hundreds of people were here, so that when the parade started at 11 o'clock both sides of Franklin and Columbia Streets were lined with men, women and children, representing Orange, Alamance, Chatham and Durham counties, in large numbers joined hands in extending to the old heroes, of which there were about thirty in number, who wore the grey, and the heroes of the world war, who went from this community to camp and battlefield and to other branches of the service, a hearty “Welcome Home”.</p>
        <p>The parade, which included in the line of march the Confederate Veterans, the overseas and training camp troops, the former S. A. T. C. students, the navy, marine and aviation men, the school children, the Boy Scouts, the flag girls, the Y. M. C. A. and the Red Cross groups, Colonel Joseph Hyde Pratt and his staff,
<pb id="p116" n="116"/>
the Daughters of the Confederacy and the Home Guard, marked the opening of the day's celebration.</p>
        <p>The parade was followed by appropriate exercises in Memorial Hall, when eloquent addresses paid fitting tribute to old and new soldiers. Splendid speeches were made by Dr. Archibald Henderson, Major L. P. McLendon, and Colonel Joseph Hyde Pratt. The spacious hall was filled to overflowing, which is to say that over 2,000 crowded in. Major William Cain presided.</p>
        <p>An elaborate spread was served to the overseas and training camp men, speakers and guests following the speech-making program. The local Daughters of the Confederacy were mainly responsible for the huge success accorded the occasion, although all Chapel Hill organizations co-operated in a splendid manner. Dr. A. H. Patterson, chief marshal, was chairman of the program committee.</p>
        <p>The parade, which began at 11 o'clock, was divided into three divisions, Lieut. E. R. Rankin was marshal of the first division, which included the band under the direction of L. F. Parker, the members of the U.D.C., the flag girls, under Miss Schell, the civil war veterans in autos, and the school children. The second division of which Lieut. F. W. Morrison was marshal, was composed of the Red Cross and Y. M. C. A. groups, the Home Guard, the march of the allies, the Boy Scouts, and the flower girls.</p>
        <p>Lieut. A. B. Sims was marshal for the third division, which included Col. Pratt and his staff; the overseas troops under the command of Lieut. H. A. Whitfield; the troops from the training camps under the command of Lieut. R. F. Moseley; the naval contingent
<pb id="p117" n="117"/>
under the command of Ensign Grady Pritchard; the aviation and marine contingents, the color companies; the service flag bearers, and the speakers for the memorial exercises.</p>
        <p>Colonel Pratt served in the capacity of general of the divisions. First Lieut. Graham Ramsey acted as colonel of the regiment, which First Lieut. Bruce Webb served as major of the University battalion. In Colonel Pratt's staff were Major P. H. Winston, First Lieut. Thorndike Savillo, and all unattached second lieutenants and other commissioned officers.</p>
        <p>Chapel Hill was bedecked in gala attire for the occasion. National and Confederate flags and “Welcome Home” banners were stretched across the streets at close intervals. The stores were also prettily decorated. The automobiles and other floats were a blaze of color.</p>
        <p>Major William Cain, one of the best and most favorably known Confederate veterans in these parts, presided over the exercises in Memorial Hall, which were opened by invocation by Rev. E. L. Baskin, formerly chaplain in the army. Major Cain, in opening the exercises and introducing the speakers who were to follow, praised in highest terms the undaunted spirit of the North Carolina troops, “who like crusaders have battled in a just cause and returned covered with glory and honor”. The 30th Division, he pointed out, which won immortal distinction, was composed largely of North Carolina troops. He voiced the welcome of the community in having the boys back again from the training camps and battle scarred fields of France.</p>
        <p>Dr. Archibald Henderson, himself the son of a Confederate
<pb id="p118" n="118"/>
veteran, was the next speaker on the program. He declared that the traditions of the '60s is today enhanced and enriched by the legacy of 1917 and 1918. “Today,” he said, “in the same breath we celebrate a lost and won cause. But”, he said, turning to the veterans, “your glory is enhanced rather than dampened by your participation in a lost cause, for you won imperishable fame which is secure.” He referred to the military leaders of the Confederacy as some of the greatest the world has ever known, citing instances where European commanders in the past war have declared that the strategies of Lee, Jackson and Forrest were unsurpassed. He paid a high tribute to the valorous troops who broke the unbreakable Hindenburg line and praised their unmeasured courage and devotion.</p>
        <p>Professor George M. McKie read a list of the Chapel Hill and University students who have made the supreme sacrifice, and paid a tribute to the dead heroes.</p>
        <p>Major L. P. McLendon, of Durham, who commanded Battery C. of the 115th Artillery, which was composed of many Chapel Hill boys, expressed the happiness of the men in returning home from France and their appreciation of the welcome accorded them by people everywhere and especially at home. He paid a high tribute to the late Charles B. Wills, a Chapel Hill boy who made the supreme sacrifice in France. He declared that the best two good results of the war were the abandonment of the selfish doctrine of localism and seclusion, and the revival of patriotism which apparently was on the wane.</p>
        <p>Colonel Joseph Hyde Pratt, who commanded the 105th
<pb id="p119" n="119"/>
Engineers, after expressing the appreciation for the reception accorded the soldiers, declared that the men never realized that America could be appreciated so much until they returned. He gave unstinted praise to the enlisted men, who at all times and under all circumstances did their work willingly. The fullest co-operation was maintained between the officers and privates, he said. He also took occasion to pay a glowing tribute to the American navy, declaring that no navy has ever accomplished such a tremendous piece of work in such a short while as the American navy during the war.</p>
