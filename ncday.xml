        <head>CELEBRATE ARMISTICE DAY AS NORTH CAROLINA DAY</head>
        <p>The Superintendent of Public Instruction is directed by law to set apart one day in each year to be known as North Carolina Day, and to publish suitable material for use in the proper observance of this day in the schools of the State.</p>
        <p>November 11th, or Armistice Day, is accordingly set apart to be observed by the schools of the State as North Carolina Day. It is fitting that the schools should observe this day. Teachers and pupils should study what our heroic and patriotic citizens did during that memorable crisis when our lives were in danger and our liberties were at stake.</p>
        <p>November 11th is both a State and National holiday. It is set apart and should be devoted to a commemoration of the deeds of our soldiers and all other patriotic citizens, who by their work, courage, and thrift saved the world from a greater catastrophe even than war.</p>
        <p>This bulletin, therefore, has been prepared in order to give the teacher a wide range of material from which to make selections for the Armistice Day program and to give the pupils a simple historical background for the proper celebration of this day. The valuable historical material incorporated herein should be used in classroom lessons, especially in the teachings of history, civics, and language. The pupils should be encouraged to work up their own readings from a study of the texts and from other sources. Our country's honor-roll should be worked up from the list of citations published herein and also from local sources of information concerning the dead. The local post of the American Legion, if there is one, could help prepare this list. In this way the real meaning of North Carolina's part in the World War may be brought to our boys and girls.</p>
        <p>Teachers should tell the story of how all the people coöperated to destroy the forces of evil and to make this world a better place in which to live. They should be taught to honor all patriotic citizens, and should be led to see that both in times of war and in times of peace he or she may be a soldier of liberty who fights the common enemies of our country. What are our common enemies? Not only hostile foreigners, but sloth, cowardice, ignorance, and disease, and it is our duty to fight them with work, courage, thrift, and intelligence.</p>
        <p>If the short-term schools in some counties have not opened by November 11th, a day should be set apart either in November or December for the proper observance of North Carolina Day.</p>
        <p>We are indebted to Mr. R. B. House, the Collector of War Records of the North Carolina Historical Commission, Raleigh, North Carolina, for the preparation of this bulletin.</p>

        <head>HOW THE WORLD WAR CAME TO THE UNITED STATES</head>
        <p>On June 29, 1914, we read in our newspapers that Prince Ferdinand of Austria had been killed while visiting a town in one of his provinces. Prince Ferdinand was the heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary. His murder was a terrible thing. We thought of it as the crime of some fanatic like the murder of Presidents Lincoln, Garfield, and McKinley in America. We thought the murderer would be caught and punished, and that that would be the end of it. Few people thought that the murder of an Austrian prince would plunge the whole world into a war when the murder of our presidents had not even caused a riot.</p>
        <p>But within a few days after this crime every great country in Europe was at war. As the war went on, first one country, then another came into it. Finally America entered this great war, too.</p>
        <p>This war lasted nearly five years, with terrible results. Seven million soldiers were killed. Twenty-five million more were wounded. Many millions of men, women, and children starved to death, or died of sickness. Many cities were destroyed. The governments in many countries were broken up. All the money that Europe had spent in a hundred years to make people well and happy would not equal the money spent in this great war. How could the murder of one man cause all this misery?</p>
        <p>The answer is, because of the German Kaiser. He used this murder as an excuse to start a war he had been planning for many years. He wanted to conquer the whole world. He broke solemn treaties and made war on innocent peoples. He broke the laws of warfare, and killed old people and little babies. He used poisoned gas on the battlefield, against all the laws of war. He sent airships to wreck hospitals where sick soldiers were lying, and to destroy peaceful villages. He broke the laws of the sea. He sank hospital ships that could not fight at all. He sank the ships of neutral nations, and left their crews to perish in boats. He sank the merchant ships of hostile countries without warning and killed innocent people. He sank without warning the Lusitania and killed women and little babies. (Among these were over a hundred American citizens.) Then he gave the school children in Germany a holiday as if he had done some great thing. He respected no law and no people that stood in the way of his greed, ambition, and tyranny.</p>
        <p>The Kaiser had persuaded Austria-Hungary to join him in his plans. He was waiting for an excuse to start a war when the Austrian prince was killed. The man who killed the Austrian prince was a Serbian. Kaiser William said to Austria, “We will blame Serbia for this, declare war on her, and conquer her.”</p>
        <p>But when they declared war on Serbia, Russia came to her aid, and with Russia came France. Russia was the kinsman and protector of Serbia, and France was the friend of Russia.</p>
        <pb id="p10" n="10"/>
        <p>The German Kaiser thought he could whip both Russia and France. Therefore, he declared war on them both. He planned to throw a great army quickly into France, whip the French, and then send all his forces against Russia. France and Germany touch each other for many miles. But France had so many forts along this frontier that the Kaiser knew he could not get through them quickly. But between France and Germany on the west lies Belgium, a level country without strong forts. The Kaiser planned to go into France through Belgium. He wanted Belgium to join him in the war by letting his armies march through to France. For Belgium, because it is level and easy to march in, had long been the battleground of Europe. But Belgium many years before had promised the other European nations that she would remain neutral in any wars between them if they would not try to march their armies through her lands. All the great nations of Europe agreed to this. The Kaiser, also, had solemnly promised not to march into Belgium. But now he said to the Belgians:</p>
        <q direct="unspecified">
          <p>“I am going to break my promise. You will have to let my armies through or fight.”</p>
        </q>
        <p>The Belgians replied:</p>
        <p>“We will fight, then!” and all the world honors Belgium for this brave answer.</p>
        <p>The Kaiser invaded Belgium and did many horrible things. He burned her cities. He murdered her innocent people. He made slaves of many more, and took them into Germany. His invasion of Belgium brought Great Britain into the war, because she had promised to defend the neutrality of Belgium.</p>
        <p>Although the Kaiser had built a great navy, it was nothing to compare with that of Great Britain. The British ships quickly ran all the German ships off the seas, and blockaded all the German ports. No ship could get in or out of Germany. The Kaiser's people could not make enough provisions and ammunition for his armies. He could not trade with the outside world. He was afraid he would have to give up the war.</p>
        <p>But he had one resource left. He had many submarines. These could slip by the English ships and get out on the high seas. There they began to sink, without a word of warning, all ships going to or from England. This was against the laws of war even when he sank English ships. For when a war-ship sinks the merchant ship of a hostile nation, it must give warning so that the sailors and passengers can save themselves. For they are noncombatants. But the Kaiser went even further. He sank the ships of any nation without any warning at all. In this way he sank over a thousand ships of neutral nations. All of these nations protested in the name of the law. But the Kaiser said:</p>
        <q direct="unspecified">
          <p>“I will not respect the law of the high seas. I will conquer them, too.”</p>
        </q>
        <p>Many of these nations were not able to protect their ships. But America was able. She warned the Kaiser from the very first that to
<pb id="p11" n="11"/>
sink American ships would mean war. The Kaiser knew this, but he thought he could whip America, too. He went on from one crime to another against us, and we realized his evil plans against our country, Then America came into the war with all her might. She joined forces with the Allies in a solemn agreement not to stop until the Kaiser was whipped forever.</p>

        <head>OUR RECORD IN THE WORLD WAR</head>
        <p>The people of America went into the war with all their might. They had but one thought—to free the world from the fear and tyranny of Germany. Thousands of men rushed into the army and navy. Thousands of men and women became nurses and welfare workers in the camps. Millions joined the Red Cross, the Young Men's Christian Association, the Knights of Columbus, the Salvation Army, and other societies to care for the health, the comfort, and the pleasure of the soldiers. Business men left their factories and offices to work for the government without pay. Almost everybody made sacrifices to save food and fuel for our armies and those of our allies. From the pockets of the people billions of dollars poured into the United States Treasury to pay for these things.</p>
        <p>The Government itself made great preparations for war. Many new warships were built, and the navy was greatly increased. Plans were made to raise and train an army of many millions. Thirty-seven great training camps were built. Hundreds of factories were changed from making peace-time articles to making munitions of war. The government took charge of railroads, telegraph lines, and shipping companies in order to hasten soldiers and supplies to Europe.</p>
        <p>Eight hundred thousand men were enrolled in our navy. A powerful fleet of ships was sent to Europe, where it joined the British fleet in protecting our ships and those of our friends. Our navy fought no great naval battle because the German ships were afraid to come out and fight. But it kept faithful watch over the German submarines and destroyed many of them. Day and night, in calm and in storms, and in the bitter cold of the North Sea, our sailors did their work. Together with the British, they kept the seas safe for America and her allies.</p>
        <p>Four million men were enrolled in the American army. Of these over 2,000,000 went to France and fought there in the great battles of 1918. At Chateau-Thierry, Belleau Wood, St. Mihiel, Bellicourt, and in the Argonne Forest they bore their share in some of the greatest battles in all the history of the world. Time after time they defeated some of Germany's best veterans.</p>
        <p>In this great national effort each state did its full share. No state has cause to boast over any other state, for all served alike.</p>

        <p>North Carolina boys rushed across to join the allies in the early days of the war. Some of these, like Kiffin Rockwell and James McConnell, were great fighters. Some of them, like Robert Bridgers, drove ambulances and cared for the wounded. North Carolina women went, too, as nurses and workers in the camps and hospitals.</p>
        <p>Seventy-three thousand North Carolinians went into the army; 9,000 went into the navy and the marine corps. These men were in every division of the regular army that fought in France, and on every ship that served on the seas. One of our own divisions, the 30th, broke the Hindenburg line in the most famous battle of the war. Another of our own divisions, the 81st, was moving victoriously through the Argonne Woods when the <sic corr="armistice">Amistice</sic> was signed.</p>
        <p>North Carolina gave $160,000,000 in Liberty Bonds and War Savings Stamps, and over $3,000,000 to the Red Cross and other societies working for the soldiers. Thousands of our citizens worked to make comforts and necessities for the soldiers. We made over 2,500,000 articles for their use. Josephus Daniels, Secretary of the Navy, was a North Carolinian; Walter Hines Page, the ambassador to England, was also a North Carolinian. North Carolina business men, lawyers, doctors and others served throughout the war without pay. No call for men, for money, for work, for aid of any kind was made in vain to North Carolina.</p>

        <head>HOW WE HELPED THE GOVERNMENT</head>
        <p>By watching Europe at war for three years our Government had learned to organize for the war. It had learned how to provide the five great necessities of a nation at war: men, money, food, fuel, and the coöperation of all the people. To provide these things the Government organized the draft boards to get men, the Liberty Loan committees to get money, the food administration to get food, the fuel administration to get fuel, and the Council of Defense to see that every one had something to do.</p>
        <p>Over a million men volunteered in the army and navy. Many more would have volunteered, but the Government chose a better way to raise men. This was by the draft. The draft law required every man between 18 and 45 years of age to register at a bureau in his home community. Then as the men were needed, they were called into service from every part of the country. There were few people who opposed the draft. The men called into service went gladly, and thousands of men and women helped administer the draft without one cent of pay.</p>
        <p>Many interesting stories are told about the draft. One especially shows a fine sense of honor and patriotism. A boy in one of the western counties of North Carolina appeared before the draft board in his county and asked to be sent into the army at once. He was asked why he did not wait until he was called in regular order. He replied that he wanted to redeem the honor of his family. He told how a relative of his had been called into service in the Civil War and had deserted from the army. The boy had always felt disgraced by this uncle's cowardice, and he wanted to honor his family by his own services in this war. He was sent to camp, where he made a fine record.</p>
        <p>In another North Carolina county a boy was called up for service, but never appeared before the board. He was branded as a deserter and hunted for throughout the whole time of the war. Finally he was discovered. He had imagined that he would not get to France quickly enough through the draft; therefore, when he was called up, he changed his name, ran away, and joined the regular army. He got into trouble for thus violating the draft law, but the Government pardoned him because of his brave spirit.</p>
        <p>There are many stories of bravery and patriotism told about the draft. There are also stories of cowardly and ignorant men, for not all men are what they ought to be. But the records show that only a few North Carolinians deserted from the army. By far the greater part of these were poor, ignorant men, who did not understand what the Government wanted them to do. As soon as they understood that they were to fight to protect their country they went gladly to war.</p>
        <p>These deserters were ignorant. Many of them could not read or write. Therefore, they could not understand what the war was about. Ignorant
<pb id="p16" n="16"/>
people like this are a great danger to a nation, because they are so easily deceived. This is shown by a disaster that happened to the Italian army in 1917. Italy spends so much money for her army and navy that she has little left for schools. Consequently many of the Italian soldiers never learned to read and write. The Germans knew this, and kept spreading false reports by spies in the Italian army. These spies told the soldiers that the war was nearly over, and that Germany was not going to attack Italy any more. So many of the soldiers believed these rumors that the Italian army became careless on the battlefield. Then Germany made a big attack and came near destroying the whole Italian army.</p>
        <p>The Germans tried to play the same tricks on our soldiers, but they were too well informed. The ignorant men called into our armies were sent to school by the Government. For a man who cannot read and write cannot learn how to use the weapons, maps and books that a soldier must use in modern warfare.</p>
        <p>The Government needed billions of dollars to carry on the war. There was no way to get this money quickly except by borrowing it from the people. People had to be persuaded to lend their money to the Government. They were persuaded by the Liberty Loan speakers. In every community in the United States patriotic citizens went about explaining to the people why it was necessary to lend their money to the Government. They showed how the man who loaned money to the Government would both save money and help the Government, too. Success everywhere met their efforts. Not a single state failed to raise the amount asked of it. North Carolina raised $160,000,000, which was $10,000,000 more than was asked. Mr. Joseph G. Brown and Mr. John W. Fries directed the work of raising money in North Carolina. Most of the people understood that the Government was simply borrowing the money, and would surely pay it back. But an old negro farmer in Nash County was surprised to learn that he would be repaid. He had <hi rend="italics">given</hi> three hundred dollars to the Government, as he thought. He said people ought to give money when boys were giving their lives.</p>
        <p>It meant a sacrifice for many of the people to spare their money. One North Carolina woman, a widow, loaned the Government one hundred dollars. The money she put down was all in dimes. It was learned that for many years she had been saving ten cents at a time from her earnings. Now she was willing to turn it all over to her country. Rich and poor, men, women, and children—all loaned their money to help win the war.</p>
        <p>All over the world men had stopped raising food because they had to enter the army to fight. Many thousand farms had been ruined by the contending armies. People cannot work and fight without plenty of food. Experience taught us that food would win the war. Our Government organized the Food Administration to produce food and to save it. The United States had to feed not only its own people, but its allies.</p>
        <pb id="p17" n="17"/>
        <p>Every one was urged to plant food crops and to raise cattle and poultry. The burden of raising food of course fell on the farmers. But in towns and cities home-owners planted gardens. People were urged not to leave a foot of land unplanted with food crops. Those who had no land to plant were urged to work on the farms and gardens. Even school children were asked to plant gardens at school. In military camps in this country and in France there were many war gardens.</p>
        <p>All the people were glad to raise food, but it was hard to get them to save it. The average American family throws away enough food to support an extra person. When our troops passed through England, the English government sent special men to our mess halls to pick up and save the food we threw away. Restaurants, hotels, and dining cars especially wasted food by serving too large portions to guests. Sugar, wheat and beef were the things most wasted, and at the same time most needed. Our people began to save food as soon as they had their attention called to the need. Skillful people prepared all sorts of dishes from oats, corn meal, molasses, fish, and such things, and saved the beef, sugar and wheat for our soldiers and our allies.</p>
        <p>In each county of the State were committees to help save food. Mr. Henry A. Page, of Aberdeen, directed the production and saving of food for the whole State of North Carolina.</p>
        <p>Fuel was just as necessary as food. The chief fuel of the world is coal. So many men were taken from the mines to fight that coal was scarce all over the world. Moreover, the winter of 1917-1918 was one of the most severe we have ever had. Factories had to keep going to make munitions and clothing, and people had to be kept warm.</p>
        <p>The Government organized the Fuel Administration to regulate the supply of fuel. When there was plenty of wood, as in North Carolina, little coal was allowed. Of course we had to have coal for our factories and our light and power plants. Where there was little wood, as in New England, much more coal was allowed. The people were glad to save fuel. Mr. A. W. McAllister and Mr. R. C. Norfleet directed the fuel-saving work in North Carolina.</p>
        <p>Thousands of people were ready to help the Government. They simply wanted to know how to go about it. The Government, therefore, organized the Council of Defense to show the people how to help the Government. There were small councils of defense in every county, and at the head of all of these smaller councils in each state was one large council. Dr. D. H. Hill directed the North Carolina Council of Defense.</p>
        <p>The members of the Council of Defense served in many ways. They kept watch in every neighborhood against traitors and slackers. They helped sell liberty bonds and war savings stamps. They encouraged the people to plant gardens and showed them how. They raised money for
<pb id="p18" n="18"/>
the Red Cross and other welfare organizations. Wherever anything worth while was going on in the State there was a Council of Defense busily at work.</p>
        <p>The result of all these efforts was a state united, with men, women and children at work. Men, money, food, fuel and help never failed. These great organizations took the time, strength and money of thousands of our citizens. But all gave themselves freely. Joseph G. Brown, John W. Fries, Henry A. Page, A. W. McAllister, R. C. Norfleet, D. H. Hill, all served without pay as directors for the whole State. In every county prominent citizens likewise gave their services to the Government as soldiers of liberty.</p>
      </div1>
      <div1 type="section">
        <head>WELFARE WORK AT HOME AND ABROAD</head>
        <p>The people of North Carolina not only furnished soldiers to the Government, they also sent welfare workers to the camps and to France to care for them. They formed societies at home to make clothing, bandages and comforts for the soldiers. They took care of the relatives of soldiers who needed any kind of help. Moreover, they helped many other people who needed aid for any reason.</p>
        <p>The greatest of all our welfare organizations was the Red Cross. In every neighborhood throughout the land there were branches of the Red Cross. In North Carolina there were 250,000 members. These patriotic workers made over 2,500,000 articles for the soldiers. They sent men and women to the camps in this country, and to France to nurse and care for the soldiers. One North Carolina girl went to Belgium in 1914 as a British Red Cross nurse. She served throughout the war, and was under fire most of the time. For her service she has been decorated by France, Belgium, and Great Britain. Her name is Madelon Battle Hancock. She was born in Asheville and now lives in England.</p>
        <p>While the Red Cross was serving the soldiers so nobly, a new call was made on it here at home. A dread disease called influenza swept over the land killing many thousand people. Often all the members of a whole family would be stricken with no one to care for them. Often people would be stricken who were too poor to get a doctor or a nurse. In all such cases the Red Cross organized hospitals, and sent doctors and nurses to care for the sick. Many of these doctors and nurses fell sick and died in this service. They, too, were heroic soldiers fighting a terrible enemy.</p>
        <p>A fine branch of the Red Cross work was the canteen, as the service station at the railroad stations was called. These canteens furnished hot meals and other comforts to soldiers passing through on troop trains. A famous canteen was at Raleigh. It served over 250,000 soldiers, and never failed to meet any demand on it.</p>
        <pb id="p19" n="19"/>
        <p>Akin to the Red Cross was the War Camp Community Service in all towns near which soldiers were encamped. This organization entertained the soldiers as the guests of the towns. Raleigh, Fayetteville, Charlotte, Wilmington, and Southport, had active organizations of this kind. There were also the Y. M. C. A., the Knights of Columbus, the Jewish Welfare Board, the churches, and many others working for the welfare of the soldiers. Thousands of North Carolinians did actual work in these organizations. The people of the State gave over $3,000,000 to help them in their work.</p>

          <head>EDWARD KIDDER GRAHAM</head>
          <p>We have learned how great and busy men gave their services to the Government without pay. They sold liberty bonds, worked to save food and fuel, helped to raise the army, and worked for the Red Cross and other welfare organizations. There were hundreds of men and women who served the Government in this way. We honor all of them as unselfish and good citizens. We honor in particular Edward Kidder Graham because of the greatness and goodness of his life and because he gave his life in the service.</p>
          <p>Edward Kidder Graham was the President of our State University. He began his work in life as a teacher, and he died while working as a teacher and example to all of us. He was born at Charlotte, North Carolina, October 11, 1876. After preparing for college in his native city he entered the University of North Carolina in 1894. At the University he was a fine student, a keen debater, and a brilliant writer. His classmates honored him for these qualities. But they honored him even more as a clean, fair, and sportsmanlike man. He knew how to lead men. His fellow students said that Ed Graham had a habit of being right.</p>
          <p>Soon after he graduated in 1898, he began to teach in the University. He was a wonderful teacher because he knew young men and could inspire and guide them. His fame as a teacher went all over the country, and many great colleges asked him to leave the University and come teach for them. They offered him money and positions greater than the University could give him at the time. But Edward Graham would never leave the University because he loved it. The University rewarded him for his loving service by giving him positions of high trust and honor.</p>
          <p>Finally in 1915 he was made President of the University. All the State rejoiced in the honor that had come to him. He inspired the students and teachers in the University, and the people of the State, so that never before had North Carolina believed more in education. He worked day and night guiding the University and the State toward better citizenship. Education and Citizenship were his watchwords.</p>
          <p>Then came the war. No man knew better than Edward Kidder Graham why we were in the war, and how we must work to win it. He offered his services to the Government, though he was already hard
<pb id="p22" n="22"/>
worked with his duties as president of the University. He helped organize the schools of the country to study the war. He helped direct the Council of Defense for the whole United States. He helped direct the Young Men's Christian Association in its work all over the world, and he had special charge of the colleges in the South Atlantic States which were training young men for the army.</p>
          <p>These duties were more than any one man could discharge. Therefore Edward Kidder Graham destroyed his health by hard work. He became sick with influenza, and because he was so weakened by overwork he could not resist the disease. He died October 26, 1918.</p>
          <p>The United States lost in him one of its right-hand men. North Carolina lost in him a great leader. Men who had studied and worked with him mourned for him as a friend. His was a great and strong life which he gave in service to humanity. Edward Kidder Graham was a soldier of liberty.</p>

          <head>KIFFIN YATES ROCKWELL</head>
          <p>On September 23, 1916, the world learned that the aviator Kiffin Rockwell was dead. He had fallen in an air battle in France. Both enemy and friend paid tribute to Rockwell's memory, because of his bravery and skill. He was a leader in that group of men who left their own peaceful countries to fight for France. They believed that France was protecting the rights of the whole world.</p>
          <p>Kiffin Rockwell was an American. He was born in Tennessee, but he lived most of his life in North Carolina. For this reason North Carolina claims him, too, and honors his memory.</p>
          <p>Kiffin Rockwell and his brother Paul loved France. Their ancestors were French, and these two boys decided long before the war came that they would fight for France if she was ever attacked by Germany.</p>
          <p>When France was attacked by Germany in 1914 they went at once to France and joined the French army. Their regiment was the Foreign Legion. It was given this name because it was made up of men from all over the world who wanted to fight for France. In it were many boys from the United States. Victor Chapman, James McConnell, Norman Prince, are the names of some of them. All these men gave their lives for France. All of them are honored as heroes. None of them has greater fame than Kiffin Rockwell. James McConnell was also a North Carolinian. Kiffin and his brother Paul fought for over a year in the trenches. Both received serious wounds. Paul was crippled so that he could not fight any more. Kiffin got well and strong again. He left the Foreign Legion and became an aviator. Then he joined the Lafayette squadron of France and became a great air fighter. May 18, 1916, he brought down the first German plane that was brought down by
<pb id="p23" n="23"/>
an American. Soon he brought down more. It was said of him: “Where Rockwell is the Germans cannot pass.” He would never rest except when his airplane needed gas or repairs. As soon as his plane was ready, off he would go in search of the Germans. He gained the highest honors that France can bestow on a soldier, but he said, “I am only paying the debt America owes to France.”</p>
          <p>Rockwell fought over a hundred battles in the air. But on September 23, 1916, while he was fighting a German plane, a machine-gun bullet struck him in the eye. The great aviator fell to the earth dead. His comrades said. “The best and bravest of us is no more.”</p>
          <p>In 1916 few Americans thought we would get into the war. We could not understand why American boys should want to give their lives for France. Even Kiffin Rockwell's mother could not see for a long time why he should fight for France. But Kiffin wrote to her one day and said:</p>
          <q direct="unspecified">
            <p>“If I die I want you to know that I have died as every man ought to die—fighting for what is right. I do not feel that I am fighting for France alone, but for the cause of all humanity—the greatest of all causes.”</p>
          </q>
          <p>In a little while the United States was in this war. Like Kiffin Rockwell, we fought for all humanity against Germany. For this reason we honor Kiffin Rockwell as a pioneer. He led us in a crusade for humanity.</p>

        <div2 type="section">
          <head>ROBERT LESTER BLACKWELL</head>
          <p>Of the 82,000 North Carolinians who went into the army and navy, some died gloriously on the field of battle; some died from horrible wounds; some died of disease. Others went through the same dangers without a scratch. Others never went to France at all, but served here at home.</p>
          <p>Why was this so? The answer is—the fortunes of war. When a man joins the army of his country he lays aside for the time his own will and interests. It is not what he wants, but what his superiors think best that he does. This is true from the humblest private to the commanding general of all the armies.</p>
          <p>The watchword of the army is service. Service means to obey orders. That is what every soldier is trained to do. He is trained to fear neither death nor suffering. He is trained to fear only failure to do his duty.</p>
          <p>All soldiers were serving; all had to bear the fortunes of war. One might die a glorious death; another might suffer a broken body; another might not receive a scratch. Some soldiers might go to great adventures in strange countries; others might drill and labor in training camps in their home country, but whatever fortune of war the good soldier met
<pb id="p24" n="24"/>
with, he met it in the name of service to his country. An example of the greatest service is Robert Lester Blackwell.</p>
          <p>Robert Lester Blackwell was a farmer boy. He was born in Hurdle Mills in Person County, North Carolina. When the war broke out he joined the 119th infantry and went abroad to fight. He served with honor in Belgium and on the Hindenburg line at Bellicourt. On October 11, 1918, in a great battle before St. Souplet in France, he and a few of his comrades were cut off from their regiment by the German artillery fire. They knew that unless some one carried a message back to the regiment all of them would be captured or killed. They knew also that any man who tried to get through the German fire would probably be killed. The commanding officer asked for volunteers to carry the message. Without hesitation Blackwell stepped forward. He took the message and plunged into the hail of shells that churned up every foot of the ground. A shell struck him and the brave soldier fell dead.</p>
          <p>In memory of this brave deed Congress gave to Blackwell's father a beautiful medal of honor, the highest honor our country can bestow on a soldier. Throughout all the country was read the order citing his bravery for an act that was “above and beyond the call of duty.”</p>
          <p>Robert Lester Blackwell was not trying to win a name for himself. He was trying to save the lives of his comrades. It was an act of service such as has been described by the Master of men when He said, “Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.”</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="section">
          <head>ERNEST HYMAN</head>
          <p>Robert Lester Blackwell, of Person County, sacrificed his life in an effort to save his comrades. No officer would have commanded him to take the risk he did, because there was no hope of success. Thus his act was “above and beyond the call of duty.”</p>
          <p>Sometimes a soldier is called upon to venture his life in some crisis of battle. This is a call of duty.</p>
          <p>Ernest Hyman was a private in the 120th Infantry. On September 29, 1918, his regiment was charging the Hindenburg line at Bellicourt. It was raining, and smoke and fog filled the air. In the darkness Hyman became lost from his company. A coward would have retreated. But Hyman searched until he found another soldier. These two soldiers advanced together. They found three machine-gun nests, broke them up, and captured four German prisoners. Then they went on till they found their company. Hyman went further. He volunteered to go with a patrol, and went 600 yards into the German lines. For this heroism in battle he was given a Distinguished Service Cross. The account of his bravery was read before his comrades.</p>
          <pb id="p25" n="25"/>
          <p>Over two hundred North Carolina boys did brave deeds like Hyman's. All of them received the Distinguished Service Cross. This cross is an honor given to a man for unusual heroism in battle.</p>
          <p>Like Blackwell and Hyman, all of these men were good soldiers. They were not trying to make names for themselves. They were obeying orders. Their bravery was in the name of service.</p>
          <p>The names of all these men and the story of their bravery are in this little book. While all should be honored alike, perhaps you would like to find the heroes from your own county, and tell the story of their brave deeds on Armistice Day.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="section">
          <head>EDGAR M. HALYBURTON</head>
          <p>It is a soldier's duty not only to fight in battle, but also to serve his country wherever he may be. This is what Edgar M. Halyburton did.</p>
          <p>Edgar M. Halyburton was born at Taylorsville, North Carolina. He volunteered in the regular army and became a sergeant in the 16th Infantry. This regiment was a part of the 1st Division, and was one of the first regiments to go to France.</p>
          <p>In November, 1917, the Germans raided the American trenches and took Sergeant Halyburton a prisoner. Sergeant Halyburton was carried into Germany and kept as a prisoner of war from November, 1917, till November, 1918. He was in many German prison camps, and in none of them was he well treated. As the war went on other American prisoners of war came to these camps. The Germans tried to break their spirits and make them give valuable information about the American armies. They kept the American prisoners in dirty houses and did not give them enough to eat.</p>
          <p>Many a soldier's spirit would have broken down had it not been for Sergeant Halyburton. He organized the prisoners, and found comfortable places for them to stay in. He saw that all food and clothing due them was fairly divided among all the prisoners. He organized officers and made rules to prevent the Americans from getting discouraged and giving the Germans information about our armies.</p>
          <p>Finally in November, 1918, the Armistice was signed and Sergeant Halyburton and the other prisoners of war were sent back to the American army. There it was learned how he had served his country even while in prison. The Government thanked him publicly for these fine services by giving him a medal called the Distinguished Service Medal. Many generals, colonels and other men of high rank received this medal for the fine work they did in training and leading soldiers. But none of them deserves more credit than Sergeant Halyburton. He was not trying to win a name for himself. He was only doing his duty where he was. His was the spirit of service.</p>

          <head>A DOUGHBOY'S OWN STORY</head>
          <p>We have learned of brave deeds like Blackwell's and Hyman's. We have learned of fine services like Sergeant Halyburton's.</p>
          <p>But there were five million men in the army and navy. What of them? Are they not to be honored, too? They were all in the service. All of them offered their lives. All of them served where duty called them. Thousands of them passed through the same dangers that confronted the heroes about whom we have been studying. Let us learn about these men who called themselves “doughboys.”</p>
          <p>There is a story of a great battle as the doughboy saw it. It is told by Corporal James E. Gregory, of Pasquotank County.</p>
          <p>Corporal James E. Gregory was a North Carolina boy. He fought in Belgium, and later at Bellicourt where the Hindenburg line was broken. This is his account of the Battle of the Hindenburg Line on September 29, 1918:</p>
          <q direct="unspecified">
            <p>“At 5:50 a. m., September 29th, our division attacked the Hindenburg line. For four long hours the artillery fire continued from both sides. It looked as if the destruction of the world had begun. I could not hear the sound of a voice. Shells were falling everywhere. Shrapnel was filling the air with its horrible whistle. Wounded men were moaning and groaning on every side. They were pleading for some one to help them. German prisoners were coming over with their hands up. They were yelling ‘Kamerad!’ Enemy airplanes were whizzing low to the earth and sending showers of bullets on us. My friends everywhere were falling dead and wounded. I hardly knew what was happening. Suddenly the hardest fighting was over. We had taken the great St. Quentin tunnel and the town of Bellicourt. The Hindenburg line had been broken. We spent that night in a German dugout seventy feet underground. The night before Germans had slept there. They thought they would never have to give it up.”</p>
          </q>
          <p>This little story is true. It shows us what every soldier went through in battle. Each soldier had his duty to perform. Each one had to face death. Some were killed, but most of them went through safely. All were filled with the spirit of service.</p>

          <head>THE STORY OF “THE PRESIDENT LINCOLN”</head>
          <p>One of the finest transports in our Navy was the <hi rend="italics">President Lincoln.</hi> It was commanded by a North Carolinian, Commander Percy W. Foote. His crew was made up of young boys who had joined the Navy for the war. This great ship had made five trips to France and had carried over twenty-five thousand soldiers.</p>
          <pb id="p27" n="27"/>
          <p>May 29, 1918, the <hi rend="italics">President Lincoln</hi> left Brest, France. With her were the <hi rend="italics">Susquehana,</hi> the <hi rend="italics">Antigone,</hi> and the <hi rend="italics">Ryndam.</hi> Torpedo boat destroyers escorted them for two days. The destroyers then left the four ships to go alone. The <hi rend="italics">President Lincoln</hi> and her sister ships sailed in safety till the morning of May 31st. About nine o'clock there was a loud crash aboard the <hi rend="italics">President Lincoln.</hi> She had been struck by a torpedo from a German submarine. Every one knew that the great ship must sink. Her three sister ships had to leave her. Such were the orders. This was to keep the submarine from sinking them, too.</p>
          <p>Commander Foote gave orders to abandon the ship. All the sick and wounded men were placed in boats. All boats were lowered into the water. Then most of the sailors jumped from the sinking ship. But the gun crews remained at their posts. They fired at the submarine until the ship went down. At the last minute they jumped, too.</p>
          <p>The <hi rend="italics">President Lincoln</hi> went down with flags flying and left the sailors floating about.</p>
          <p>Then the submarine came back. The Germans were looking for prisoners. They tried to find the commanding officer, but the sailors kept him hid. Finally they captured Lieutenant Isaacs and carried him to Germany. But he escaped before the war was over.</p>
          <p>The sister ships of the <hi rend="italics">President Lincoln</hi> sent wireless messages for her aid. Finally the United States destroyer, <hi rend="italics">Warrington,</hi> learned what had happened. She was two hundred and fifty miles away. But she started for the scene at once. By skillful sailing the commander of the <hi rend="italics">Warrington</hi> sailed two hundred and fifty miles and found the ship-wrecked men by eleven o'clock on the night of the 31st.</p>
          <p>Over six hundred men were on the <hi rend="italics">President Lincoln.</hi> Of these only twenty-six lost their lives. One of these was a negro boy. He was Commander Foote's body servant, and lost his life by trying to help Commander Foote get away. Had it not been for the skill and bravery of Commander Foote in controlling his men, many more would have lost their lives. Because of his skill and bravery the United States gave him the Distinguished Service Medal, and the King of Belgium also pinned a medal on this brave sailor.</p>

        <head>OUR DEAD</head>
        <p>Eighty-two thousand North Carolinians fought in the war. One thousand six hundred of these gave their lives in battle. These are the men whom we should especially honor today. Some day their names and homes will all be known. But scholars will have to work a long time to get them all right. In the meantime you should learn as many as you can of the men from your own county who died. Their names should be read on Armistice Day, and hymns sung and prayers offered in their memory. Some of these men have been brought back from France and are now buried in their home cemeteries. Their graves should be visited this day, and decorated with flowers. Remember that these men died for us, and honor them always.</p>
