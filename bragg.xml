        <head>Preface.</head>
        <p>Our efforts have been expended toward a comprehensive description of the interesting features connected with the construction of the famous Artillery Camp within our borders, and to depict the attractiveness and commercial possibilities of the City of Fayetteville.</p>
        <p>It has been our endeavor to give a full and edifying exposition of all that is of public concern.</p>
        <p>We hope our booklet will be received with due appreciation by our readers and that we have fulfilled the object for which we have striven.</p>

        <p>GREAT historical crises have always necessitated quick decisions effecting even the most vital details of administration. When Congress voted to commit our country to the alliance against the German menace, one of the first problems that confronted the government was the selection of sites and the rapid construction of camps suitable for the mobilization of the two million men who sprang to arms
<figure id="ill1" entity="braggp5"><p>The Field Before Operations Began.</p></figure>
almost over night. Naturally, propinquity to the large centers of population and to the tide water transportation routes determined the location of the first camps to be developed and the country was soon amazed at the completion within from sixty to ninety days of such enormous undertakings as Camp Devens, Mass., Camp

Upton, N. Y., Camps Merritt and Dix, New Jersey, Camp Meade, Maryland, each capable of housing from twenty to sixty thousand men. But when the first contingents of our army were provided for and the so-called temporary camps, with their restrictions in space, were well serving the purpose for which they were established, the administration at Washington was enabled to give more time and consideration to the selection of sites for the permanent camps that were afterward decided upon. Among these and probably the most wisely chosen of all, is the site upon which now stands the camp that bears the name of the famous hero, General Braxton Bragg.</p>

        <p>In the late spring of nineteen hundred and eighteen a commission from the War Department, at the head of which was Major General Wm. J. Snow, visited Fayetteville, North Carolina, and after several days spent in touring the adjacent country, recommended the purchase or lease of land comprising 209 square miles, or 133,760 acres, 184.3 miles, or 118,000 acres, of which were subsequently acquired and have been converted into an artillery reservation, school and firing range.</p>
        <p>Many natural advantages determined the commission upon the adoption of this site, among them and perhaps the most important being the superb climate. The reservation is located upon a high plateau 300 feet

above sea level and about sixty miles from the coast as the crow flies and about 90 miles from Wilmington, the nearest seaport. The country is an old one for America, antedating in settlement the Revolutionary War by more than one hundred years. It was originally a primeval forest of long leaf pine and scrub oak. The turpentine industry, however, denuded the forest of the best of its graceful pines and left it to the cultivation of small farms of cotton and corn. But because of the absence of a substantial sub-soil these crops do not thrive as well here as in other parts of North Carolina and for this reason the raising of tobacco and wheat are rarely attempted. A rich strata of black loam covered

with beautiful clean white sand produces many varieties of truck produce, melons and sweet potatoes and gives the land an appearance of unsurpassing verdure throughout almost the entire year. The white sand left by the sea in its pre-historic recession provides a wonderful natural drainage and together with the rolling character of the surface eliminates those features which cause malaria, typhoid and allied diseases. Mosquitoes are almost unknown. There is also a marked absence of vermin of all kinds, especially those that infest swampy regions. A deep swift running stream of clear pure water draining a small lake and fed by countless creeks, bisects the reservation from end to end contributing its share to the wonderful purity of the soil. There

is an abundant rainfall uniformly distributed throughout the year, but no long period of rain as in the tropics —no rainy season. This condition keeps the air normally cool and fresh. Frequent short showers followed by warm sunshine dispel the enervating humidity that has to be so unpleasantly endured on the coast both north and south during the summer. Because of the absence of clay in the composition of the soil there is scarcely any mud. Two hours after a hard down pour the ground will be found firm and dry.</p>
        <p>It has been charged in some sections of the country that the South was shown an undue partiality in the distribution of the army camps but a little thought would

reveal the wisdom of this course. It is a well known fact that as the wealth of a nation increases a large leisure class is formed which migrates like the birds in search of the localities where out-of-door life can be enjoyed for the longest continuous periods. Within a radius of forty miles of Camp Bragg there are a number of well known resorts, such as Pinehurst and Southern Pines, which hold the record for continuous “open house” over all sections of the United States excepting only California. So then Uncle Sam in selecting Camp Bragg had a kindly purpose in giving the soldiers who so loyally serve him the same climatic advantages that, as a rule can be obtained only by the favored few. With pure air, pure water and an almost complete absence

of objectionable fauna the men quartered at Camp Bragg are given a maximum of wholesome recreation with a minimum of indoor confinement.</p>
        <p>During the summer of 1918 a preliminary survey was made and plans were drawn up for the projected camp, which covered the grouping and distribution of various units and buildings. This work was under the personal supervision of Mr. C. F. Pilat, a patriotic citizen and an experienced Civic Planner of New York City. He like many others volunteered his services to the government with the <sic corr="conscientiousness">conscienciousness</sic> of serving his country.</p>
        <p>The contract for surveying and drawing up the permanent unit plans was awarded to J. E. Sirrine, of
<figure id="ill9" entity="braggp13"><p>Main Buildings of Base Hospital.</p></figure>
Greenville, S. C., and the supervision of the work was placed in the hands of Mr. Cecil L. Reid and Earl Mauldin. That no mistake was made in the selection of this personnel is easily apparent in the location of the groups of buildings, their symmetrical arrangement, the assignment of the different blocks for specific purposes, the intersection and alignment of the concrete and sand clay roads for convenience of mobility and the general harmonizing of the whole scheme. In marked contrast to some of the camps that had to be built upon smaller areas, the buildings at Camp Bragg are erected in groups with considerable space of forest or open field between, plenty of room having been obtained for the purpose for which each group is intended.

        <p>The railroad which at the beginning of operations was only able to discharge men and material on a siding two miles from the camp center, has been so extended that a veritable net work of branches render the transportation of supplies to even the most remote points.</p>

        <p>On August 23rd, 1918, the contract for construction was awarded to James Stewart &amp; Co., Inc., of New York for an amount not to exceed $17,000,000. and originally called for a six brigade camp and a 2500 bed base hospital The construction of Camp Bragg has been accomplished under the direct supervision of Mr. R. M. Morris and Mr. D. R. Scott, who were ably assisted by a corps of skilled construction men, selected from Stewart &amp; Co.'s unequaled organization, under the personal direction of Mr. H. B. Deal. That the work could not have been placed in better hands is

attested by the record of this old, long established firm in its successful execution since its organization in 1868, of a long list of large commissions for the government here and in France, as well as for private enterprises.</p>
        <p>With the signing of the contract no time was lost by the contractors in getting on the ground and commencing work, and Monday, September 9th, 1918, saw the ground broken, the first nail driven and the precursor of the immense caravan of teams hauling lumber from the railroad siding to the site of the first building.</p>
        <p>In less than three weeks the immense Administration Building was ready for occupancy and in an incredibly brief period the first bunk houses were in use. Fine autumn weather greatly facilitated the work.

A huge army of workmen flocked to the camp site from all parts of the United States. At first the men were quartered in Fayetteville and the first mess hall serving breakfast and supper was established there. A long train from the city to the siding ten miles north left every morning and returned every evening. Although accommodations at first were perhaps the crudest known to present day railway practice, <sic corr="antiquated">antequated</sic> cattle cars being used, the journey was short and scarcely ever was a complaint heard while the exchange of homely repartee and good natured badinage enlivened each trip.</p>

        <p>In a few weeks the bunk houses were completed and a number of mess halls opened on the grounds so that the hardships of the trip to and from Fayetteville no longer bad to be endured. From the start the commissary has been good though plain and for a moderate amount the men have been supplied with good wholesome food. Each of the fifty four bunk houses is one hundred and fifty-four feet long by twenty feet wide and is capable of housing comfortably seventy men. A single iron cot with mattress and springs was allotted each man and the company provided as many blankets to the individual as he required.</p>
        <p>The winter having been a mild one, even for this climate, and the bunk houses being supplied with adequate heating facilities, there was practically no suffering

on account of the cold. Also, from the very beginning there has been a notable absence of illness and very few deaths, no epidemics and only sporadic cases of pneumonia and other diseases, which speaks volumes when the great wave of influenza that swept over the country is remembered.</p>
        <p>For the most part, the character of the men was the best to be found anywhere upon the American continent. A large percentage came from nearby farms and small localities in North Carolina and contiguous states. Many a farmer left his home after harvest and passed the winter in profitable endeavor. A large number also came from the great labor centers of the north, and
<figure id="ill18" entity="braggp21"><p>A Line of Tractors on the Field.</p></figure>
these were found to be enterprising and moral. They were for the most part men desirous of spending a delightful winter away from the scenes of vice and lawlessness, with the attendant opportunities for saving the greater part of their earnings. The isolation of the camp ten miles from the nearest town, Fayetteville, enabled comparatively easy enforcement of the prohibition law and there was as a consequence, a minimum of violence and crime. No agitation occurred to mar the peaceful pursuit of the work. This is a remarkable record when the paucity of the military and the almost entire absence of civil authority is considered in the control of a somewhat heterogeneous force of over seven thousand men. There were no tragedies.</p>

        <p>Notwithstanding the class of American labor which migrated to the fields of construction in the various localities of the south in an endeavor to take advantage of the increased rates which were being offered by the numerous contractors for common labor, it was found that the supply was utterly inadequate to meet the requirements of the work. In their dilemma the contractors were forced to obtain labor from foreign fields, such as the Mexicans, Porto Ricans, Spaniards, Cubans, and even, in some cases, the Asiatic races. This forced a condition unexpected and at the same time embarrassing to the contractors, owing to the fact that some of these laborers were diminutive in size, unacclimated
<figure id="ill20" entity="braggp23"><p>Some of the Quarters for the Boys.</p></figure>
and unable to meet in many cases what proved to them conditions to which they were unaccustomed, and could not adapt themselves. After experimenting with this class of labor at great loss of time and money, the contractors were forced to release them and proceed to make arrangements whereby they could send recruiting agents out to points where labor was concentrated, for the purpose of selecting, as far as possible, such men as might appear to be best fitted for their requirements, and even this course in most instances failed to produce adequate results.</p>

buildings were completed, the Knights of Columbus and Y. M. C. A. huts were erected and became established to the grateful appreciation of the enormous crowds who benefitted by them religiously and socially.</p>
        <p>Every night the auditoriums of these two noble institutions were filled with happy and enthusiastic audiences and the entertainments were both elevating and recuperative. The best of the screen world could be obtained merely for the effort of attendance.</p>
        <p>On May 4th, 1919, the new Liberty Theatre was informally opened. This is the most substantially constructed building in the cantonment. Its capacity is thirty-five <sic corr="hundred">bundred</sic> and it is without doubt the finest

of wide spaces through the woods and uprooting of stumps and leveling of some parts to enable the hundreds of mule teams to haul lumber and supplies. Immediate preparations were made and work commenced for the furnishing of an adequate supply of water from McFayden's lake on the reservation and pumping it into large tanks which were placed on towers about fifty feet from the ground. This supplied enough water for use until the installation of the permanent supply was completed. A large dam across Little River deflects a sufficient amount of pure fresh water into a filtration plant through which it is pumped to a large reservoir three miles away, the location chosen on account

of its elevation, and from there distributed over the entire camp. By actual government analysis the raw water was found to be 99 plus per cent. pure and yet the authorities required its filtration and chemical treatment before being used by the soldiers. The best of Redwood pipe was sent from the Pacific coast for underground conduits. The amount of water thus obtained is adequately sufficient to supply the six brigade camp originally planned and in addition would furnish enough water in excess of these requirements for a city as large as Fayetteville.</p>
        <p>With the introduction of an adequate water supply the question of plumbing and heating arose. The Fred Cantrell Company of Chattanooga, Tenn., and H. Kelly Company of Minneapolis, Minn., combined

forces for the execution of this work. So rapid yet so thorough was their work accomplished that before cold weather had permanently set in all the main buildings were equipped with running water and the wood stoves removed and supplanted by steam heating systems. A large bath house serves every two of the barrack buildings so that the soldier can drop in at any hour of the day or night and indulge in a refreshing shower of hot or cold water.</p>
        <p>The road and street paving contracts were given to T. H. Gill &amp; Co. of Binghamton, N. Y., Southern Paving Co. of Chattanooga, Tenn., and Simmons &amp; Whitten of Charlotte, N. C. The absence of mud
<figure id="ill26" entity="braggp29"><p>The Dam.</p></figure>
makes for fairly good natural roads if traffic is not too heavy, but this factor is to a large extent counterbalanced by the yielding character of the sandy surface, so with the influx of heavy army trucks and the increasing number of artillery, solid concrete roadways were constructed between the principal parts of the camp.</p>

a street hydrant situated every few hundred yards furnishes an adequate force of water when occasion may require.</p>
        <p>The crowning work of the contractors is the permanent 500 bed Base Hospital. This consists of a group of twenty two buildings and is located upon a slight eminence in section 30 commanding a fine view over the rest of the camp and the surrounding country. Its construction is of hollow tile and cement stucco, the latter work being done by the Zanzer-Reim Company of Chicago, and its total cost when completed will be over $1,000,000. It is intended by the government to equip it with every modern appliance and convenience known to modern medical science. The exacting requirements of the government for the heating, sterilizing of steam and hot water for buildings has been

admirably complied with by C. L. Reeder, Consulting Engineer of Baltimore, Md., and Edward K.

Where else in all the United States can the invalided man and the convaleseing soldier secure to such a degree the natural benefits of good air, warm sunshine, quiet and seclusion from the noise and distractions of the cities? It is unquestionably the best equipped, the most modern and the finest military hospital ever constructed. Much more could be said of the many minor facilities of the camp.

a complete camp equipment. In fact the equipment for the care and comfort of a population of over twenty thousand has grown within nine months from the forest and the cotton field to the ideal camp.</p>
        <p>As a training camp for the newly recruited artillery-man and the embryonic aviator the reservation contains miles and miles of rolling country over which <sic corr="manoeuvering">manoeuvring</sic> can take place and theoretical problems in the practice of war tried out.

the camp all that the soldier needs for his comfort, welfare and advancement in his calling.</p>
        <p>As an advantage to the State of North Carolina and particularly to the City of Fayetteville and the communities in easy reach of the camp, it must be borne in mind that the government took over a large stretch of territory that had been bereft of its once leading industry and had proven to be none too well adapted to agricultural purposes and diverted it to an enterprise for great national good. So long as the institution of war exists and so long as we shall require a large standing army, which we probably shall for some years to come, any scarcely settled section that possesses advantages for the attraction and maintenance of twenty or thirty thousand men employed in pursuits for their moral, mental and physical development cannot but derive its special share in the general benefit.</p>

        <p>THE great South is about to fulfill a deterred destiny as the ultimate home of an immense population. Its numerous opportunities for commercial development are in their infancy. Its unrivaled resources have been but little exploited. And in all that is good as relating to the south at large the State of North Carolina affords the best. Possessing as it does a plethora of the possibilities of forest,

range of mountain peaks anywhere east of the Rockies, the City of Fayetteville, the county seat of Cumberland County, North Carolina, is most picturesquely located. It is 250 feet above sea level and therefore sufficiently remote from swampy areas along the coast to be free from malaria and excessive humidity. Yet it has an outlet to tidewater being at the head of steam navigation on the Cape Fear River and the Federal government has recently commenced operations on a large scale to deepen and widen its channel on account of the rapidly increasing volume of traffic between Fayetteville and the port of Wilmington. Steamers are now plying between the two cities all the year round and a no more delightful day trip for the tourist can be enjoyed

anywhere in the United States than is provided by one of these comfortable boats.</p>
        <p>Fayetteville is served by three railroads. The main line of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad affords an easy egress north to Richmond, Washington and New York, or south to Jacksonville and the Florida coast. The Aberdeen and Rockfish Railroad connecting the trunk lines of the Seaboard Air Line at Aberdeen opens up a good route to Fayetteville from all points served by the S. A. L. and its connections, being the shortest route from Atlanta.</p>
        <p>Numerous small farms of fruit and garden truck surround the city on all sides and their products are

marketed in the large cities within only a few hours after leaving the ground. A uniform rainfall throughout the entire year with only a bare minimum of cold weather in the winter enables the grower to obtain the highest prices for his products in sections where the commodities are “out of season.” The soil along the river and for several miles on either side is one of remarkable fertility, being composed of a rich dark loam slaked with sand. For the professional agriculturist or business man inclined to the soil as an avocation, there is no better land in all the south than these small tracts either within or just outside the corporate limits of Fayetteville. The stimulus to private gardening occasioned by the economic conditions of the recent

war can find here in this pastoral paradise its fullest attainment. The rainfall in Fayetteville and contiguous territory is the most uniform in the United States. Its distribution varies from only 12.24 in the winter to 17.05 in the summer. Frequent brief showers are followed by warm sunshine which rapidly absorbs the moisture and leaves the air dry and pure. A natural drainage due to the configuration of the ground in its relation to the river and the sandy character of the soil produce a surface that makes for good communal health.

The death rate is only twelve in a thousand. Two large hospitals, The Highsmith and The Cumberland General have a large patronage from those who seek the health giving features of the town together with the skill and care to be obtained in them. The average temperature is 61 degrees, ranging from 42 in December to 80 in July. Rarely does excessive heat occur and the summer nights are invariably cool and invigorating.</p>

building operations attracted such a precipitous influx of immigration as to already effect a permanent increase to the city of about fifty per cent. With a fluctuating force of soldiers at the camp averaging twenty thousand men and with Fayetteville the sole and only center for trade and recreation the future growth of the city is absolutely assured. New hotels and restaurants are in process of construction. Many new retail stores have been established and several of those already in existence have been compelled to enlarge their space and expand their facilities. And with all this the new era in Fayetteville's commercial life has only just begun.</p>

Fayetteville has never had and does not now intend the introduction of that <sic corr="phenomenon">phenomanon</sic> of American civic life, the real estate boom. Inflation of values and unwarranted expansion of operations are two evils that the sound business sense of its citizens have always discountenanced. Up to the time of the coming of Camp Bragg there was not a vacant residence or store to be be had and since then the number of new buildings have not exceeded and indeed have not kept pace with the demand. Opportunities for conversative development along these lines are unquestionably in store for many years to come. The substantial character of the present business blocks would surprise the most

critical. Solid masonry of brick and stone with much architectural beauty predominate to an extent nowhere excelled in the south. This is evidenced in the Lafayette and Rosemont hotels, the Post Office, the Railway Station, Lafayette Theatre and the three bank buildings. There are five large cotton and two silk mills located in the immediate vicinity of the city where hundreds of people are employed. By new processes of distillation recently discovered the turpentine industry, once the leading industrial factor in this section has acquired a new impetus, the product being extracted from the pine trees that were formerly discarded. An immense plant for the manufacture of this commodity is in full operation within the limits of the town. On account of the low cost of power, much of it obtained

from the natural waterways which traverse the city from two sides, the inducement to other manufacturers is readily demonstrable and there are several new enterprises in prospect.</p>
        <p>The main streets of Fayetteville are well paved with asphalt and concrete and the sidewalks all over the City with concrete and flag.</p>
        <p>A convenient and well operated street railway will soon connect the boat landing at Cape Fear River with the civic center at Camp Bragg, a distance of nearly fifteen miles. The cars will run at sufficiently brief intervals to permit friends and relatives of the boys there stationed the privilege of frequent visits to this beautiful and interesting military reservation. As a short pleasure trip

for the tourist it cannot be excelled. The country roads extending from the city are remarkably free from mud and steep grades and on account of the slightly rolling country are a joy to the automobilist.</p>
        <p>The retail stores display an attractiveness far in advance of what might be expected in a place of similar size and in the variety and volume of goods afford a market adequate to every need of the most fastidious and exacting.</p>
        <p>In the social, religious and cultural life of Fayetteville the residents enjoy an atmosphere comparable to any community in the United States. It has been said that North Carolina holds the lead for church attendance over any state in the Union. Several large

churches representing the Baptist, the Episcopal, Methodist, Presbyterian and Roman Catholic denominations are crowded with earnest adherents on all occasions of public worship. Certainly a Sunday passed in Fayetteville would prove the devout, God fearing inclinations of its inhabitants, as well as the power and personality of its presiding clergymen. Beautiful church edifices appeal to the spiritual wants and desires of almost every creed.</p>
        <p>The graded schools are above the average. Well lighted, well ventilated buildings containing ample space and every known convenience of illumination and sanitation provide for the care and comfort of the pupils.

The curricula extend from the rudiments of education clear through the advanced high school course entitling the aspirant to entrance into college or business life. The Donaldson Military School with an enviable reputation all over the country for the development of manly character in youth is situated on the outskirts of the city. A salubrious climate enabling the student a maximum of outdoor life and physical exercise combined with a course promoting the highest intellectual and moral growth have placed the Institution in the front rank of Military Schools. Commodious buildings and spacious grounds contribute materially to the wants of the three or four hundred boys enrolled from all over the United States.</p>

The sturdy Anglo Celtic character of its inhabitants is strikingly exhibited to this day in their <sic corr="homogeneity">homogeniety</sic> and their rigid regard for the enforcement of law and order, the result is a city of much private wealth, of charming homes in a setting of great natural beauty. In the war of the Revolution her sons made their contribution to the common cause in self sacrificing heroism. Marion's men, famous in song and story enrolled many of its quota from the flower of Cumberland County. The City's centrality of location was so well appreciated in those primitive days that soon after the war it became for a number of years

one of the alternate seats of the General Assembly of the State. In 1824 the name of the town was changed from Campbellton or Cross Creek to Fayetteville in honor of General LaFayette. This distinguished General visited here on his second visit to America in 1824 and was lavishly entertained, the town having been the first to take its present name in his honor. The Federal constitution was ratified here in 1789.</p>
        <p>After all the human equation is the determining factor in the development of a country, be it nation, state or municipality.

Racial character produced the result in favor of the two North American cities against less advantageous physical conditions. But if a people possess these sterling traits that make for stability, right living and higher ideals and are also favored with an environment having all that is propitious in nature—the best of climate, soil and water, such a people are bound to attain the greatest and noblest ends of destiny.
